  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thus we were told in words Divine</div>
      <div class='line'>That there were truths men could not bear</div>
      <div class='line'>E’en from the lips of Christ to hear.</div>
      <div class='line'>These have now slowly been unfurled,</div>
      <div class='line'>But still to a reluctant world.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Prophets will yet arise to teach</div>
      <div class='line'>Truths which the school-men fail to reach,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which priestly doctrine still would hide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And worldly votaries deride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And statesmen fain would set aside.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I make no apology for this preface. It may be
unusual but then the book it deals with is unusual.
There is but one object in “Gloriana.” It is
to speak of evils which do exist, to study facts which
it is a crime to neglect, to sketch an artificial position—the
creation of laws false to Nature—unparalleled
for injustice and hardship.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Many critics, like the rest of humanity, are apt to
be unfair. They take up a book, and when they find
that it does not accord with their sentiments, they
attempt to wreck it by ridicule and petty, spiteful
criticism. They forget to ask themselves, “Why is
this book written?” They altogether omit to go
to the root of the Author’s purpose; and the result
is, that false testimony is often borne against principles
which, though drastic, are pure, which, though
sharp as the surgeon’s knife, are yet humane; for
it is genuine sympathy with humanity that arouses
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no romance worth reading, which has not
the solid foundation of truth to support it; there is no
excuse for the existence of romance, unless it fixes
thought on that truth which underlies it. Gloriana
may be a romance, a dream; but in the first instance,
it is inextricably interwoven with truth, in the second
instance, dreams the work of the brain are species of
thought, and thought is an attribute of God. Therefore
is it God’s creation.</p>

<p class='c008'>There may be some, who reading “Gloriana,” will feel
shocked, and be apt to misjudge the author. There are
others who will understand, appreciate, and sympathise.
There are yet others, who hating truth, will receive it
with gibes and sneers; there are many, who delighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>in the evil which it fain would banish, will resent it as
an unpardonable attempt against their liberties. An
onslaught on public opinion is very like leading a
Forlorn Hope. The leader knows full well that death
lies in the breach, yet that leader knows also, that
great results may spring from the death which is
therefore readily sought and faced. “Gloriana” pleads
woman’s cause, pleads for her freedom, for the just acknowledgment
of her rights. It pleads that her equal
humanity with man shall be recognised, and therefore
that her claim to share what he has arrogated
to himself, shall be considered. “Gloriana,” pleads
that in woman’s degradation man shall no longer be
debased, that in her elevation he shall be upraised and
ennobled. The reader of its pages will observe the
Author’s conviction, everywhere expressed, that Nature
ordains the close companionship not division of the
sexes, and that it is opposition to Nature which produces
jealousy, intrigue, and unhealthy rivalry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gloriana” is written with no antagonism to man.
Just the contrary. The Author’s best and truest
friends, with few exceptions, have been and are men.
But the Author will never recognise man’s glory and
welfare in woman’s degradation.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And hark! a voice with accents clear</div>
      <div class='line'>Is raised, which all are forced to hear.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>’Tis woman’s voice, for ages hushed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleading the cause of woman crushed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleading the cause of purity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of freedom, honour, equity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the lost and the forlorn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all for whom the Christ was born.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If, therefore, the following story should help men
to be generous and just, should awaken the sluggards
amongst women to a sense of their Position, and should
thus lead to a rapid Revolution it will not have been
written in vain.</p>

      <div class='line'>Maremna sleeps.</div>
      <div class='line'>One rosy cheek lies pillow’d on her hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And through her waving, wandering auburn curls</div>
      <div class='line'>The zephyr cupids frolic merrily,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tossing them to and fro upon her brow</div>
      <div class='line'>In sportive play. It is a brow of thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>Endow’d by God and Nature, though, alas!</div>
      <div class='line'>Held in paralysis by selfish laws</div>
      <div class='line'>Which strive to steal a fair inheritance,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bid the woman bow the knee to man.</div>

      <div class='line'>The white lids veil the large grey, lustrous eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>The auburn lashes sweep the sunlit cheeks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet are they wet, and cling to the soft skin</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereon the damp of tears is glazing fast.</div>
      <div class='line'>Maremna’s sleep is not the sleep of rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever and anon the blood-red lips</div>
      <div class='line'>Unclose, and strive to speak, but yet remain</div>
      <div class='line'>Silent and speechless, tied by some dread force</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Long ere Religion’s dogma intervened.</div>
      <div class='line'>Child of a chieftain o’er whose broad domains</div>

      <div class='line'>Loving the mountain crag and forest lone,</div>
      <div class='line'>The straths and corries, rugged glens and haunts</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the red deer and dove-like ptarmigan;</div>
      <div class='line'>Loving the language of the torrent’s roar,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or the rough river’s wild bespated rush;</div>
      <div class='line'>Loving the dark pine woods, amidst whose glades</div>
      <div class='line'>The timid roe hides from the gaze of man;</div>
      <div class='line'>Loving the great grey ocean’s varying face,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now calm, now rugged, rising into storm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Anon so peaceful, so serene, and still,</div>
      <div class='line'>When passion’s fury sinks beneath the wave.</div>

      <div class='line'>Yet is Maremna now no more a child,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor guileless with the innocence of youth.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hers it has been to roam God’s mighty world,</div>
      <div class='line'>And learn the ways and woful deeds of men,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, weary with her world-wide pilgrimage,</div>
      <div class='line'>Maremna’s steps have sought her early haunts,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hoping for rest where childhood once did play.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rest for Maremna!</div>
      <div class='line'>An idle thought; a foolish sentiment!</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the brain which God has bidden “Think”</div>
      <div class='line'>No rest can come from Solitude’s retreat;</div>
      <div class='line'>For solitude breeds thought, and shapes its course</div>
      <div class='line'>And bids it live within the form of speech,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Or bids the mighty pen proclaim its life,</div>
      <div class='line'>And write its words upon the scrolls of men.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus with Maremna.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rest she has sought, but sought it all in vain.</div>
      <div class='line'>What God decrees no mortal hand can stay.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Think.” He ordains, and lo! the brain <em>must</em> think,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor close its eyes upon the mammoth truth.</div>
      <div class='line'>Truth must prevail! Truth must be held aloft!</div>
      <div class='line'>What matter if the cold world sneers or scoffs?</div>
      <div class='line'>Sneering and scoffing is the work of man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Truth, the almighty handiwork of God.</div>
      <div class='line'>It may be dimm’d, it may be blurr’d from sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet must it triumph in the end, and win;</div>
      <div class='line'>For is not truth a sun which cannot die,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though unbelief may cloud it for a time?</div>
      <div class='line'>Maremna sleeps;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sleeps where in childhood oft she lay and dream’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dream’d of fantastic worlds and fairy realms.</div>
      <div class='line'>And now, in sleep, Maremna dreams again,</div>
      <div class='line'>But dreams no more of elves and laughing sprites.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hers, though a dream, is stern reality,</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“I am tired, mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tired, child! And why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mother, I have been spouting to the wild sea
waves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what have you been saying to them, Gloria?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, mother! ever so much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us look at the speakers, a mother and child,
the former as she stands leaning against a stone
balustrade, which overlooks a small Italian garden,
upon which the sun is shining brightly. Far out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>beyond is the gleaming sea, and on its sparkling,
silvery sheen the woman’s eyes are absently fixed
as she hearkens to the complaining prattle of the
child by her side. She is a beautiful woman is
Speranza de Lara, one upon whom Dame Nature has
showered her favours freely. As the stranger, looking
upon her for the first time, would deem her but a girl
in years, and exclaim admiringly at her beauty, it
would be difficult to convince him that her age is
thirty-five, as in effect it is.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speranza’s eyes are blue, with the turquoise shade
lighting up their clear depths, and a fringe of silky
auburn eyelashes confining them within bounds. Her
magnificent hair is of a slightly lighter hue, and as
the sun plays on the heavy coil that is twisted gracefully
upon her noble head, the golden sparks dance
merrily around it, like an aureole of gold.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the child? We must look nearer still at her,
for she not only is beautiful, but there is writ upon
her face the glowing sign of genius. Like her mother,
Gloriana, or, as we shall prefer to call her, Gloria, has
blue eyes, but they are the blue of the sapphire, deep
in contradistinction to the turquoise shade, which
characterises those of Speranza. Auburn eyelashes,
too, fringe the child’s wonderful eyes, but again these
are many shades darker than the mother’s, while
masses of auburn curls play negligently and unconfined,
covering the girl’s back like a veil of old-gold.
Such is Gloriana de Lara at the age of twelve.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Won’t Gloria tell mother what that ‘<em>ever so much</em>’
was?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She puts the question gently, does Speranza. She
has never moved from the position in which we first
found her, and her eyes are still dreamily searching
the waste of blue waters beyond. But as she speaks
the child puts her arm caressingly through that of
the mother’s, and lays her golden head against that
mother’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! yes, mother, of course I will tell <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then tell me, Gloria.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was imagining the foam flakelets to be girls,
mother, and I looked upon them as my audience. I
told them, mother darling, of all the wrongs that girls
and women have to suffer, and then I bade them rise
as one to right these wrongs. I told them all I could
think of to show them how to do so, and then I told
them that I would be their leader, and lead them to
victory or die. And the wavelets shouted, mother.
I seemed to hear them cheer me on, I seemed to see
them rising into storm, the wind uprose them, and
their white foam rushed towards me, and I seemed to
see in this sudden change the elements of a great
revolution.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Like a dream, Gloria.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A living dream, mother; at least it was so to me.
It brought a feeling to my heart, mother, which I
know will never leave it more, until, until——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl pauses, and the great tears rise to her eyes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Speranza raises herself suddenly, and, confronting the
child, lays both hands upon her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Until what, child?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Until I’ve won, mother,” cries Gloria, as she
raises her glorious eyes, in which the tears still
tremble, to her mother’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, Gloria! the odds are against you, my darling.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t I know that, mother; don’t I know that
well? But I am not afraid. I made a vow, mother,
to-day, I made it to those waves; and something tells
me that I shall keep that vow and win, though in
doing so I may die.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, Gloria, hush, child; don’t talk like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And don’t you want me to win, mother? After all
you have suffered, after all you have taught me, would
you have your child turn back from the path she has
set herself to follow, because perhaps at that path’s
end lies death?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Child, it is a cause I would gladly lay down my
life for, but how can I bring myself to wish you to
sacrifice yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is sacrifice in a great cause, mother? I fear
no sacrifice, no pain, no consequence, so long as victory
crowns me in the end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The mother’s arms are round her child’s neck now,
her head is bending down and the bright gold of
Speranza’s lovely hair is close beside the glossy,
wandering dark gold curls of Gloria. In the heart of
the former a new-born hope is rising, vague, undefinable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>yet still there, and which fills it with a happiness
she has not known for many and many a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My child,” she exclaims softly, “can it be, that
after all these years of weary, lonely suffering, I am
awaking to find in you, you, the offspring of a forbidden
love, the messenger that shall awake the world to
woman’s wrongs, and make suffering such as I have
endured <em>no longer possible</em>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, mother, I feel it,” answers Gloria earnestly;
“and that is why I have made my plans to-day.
Everything must have a beginning you know, mother,
and therefore I must begin, and begin at once. You
must help me, mother darling. I can do nothing
without your co-operation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me your plans, Gloria, and mother will help
you if she can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My plans are many, but the first must have a
premier consideration. Mother, I must go to school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To school, child! I thought you always have
begged me not to send you to school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must be to a boy’s school, mother. You must
send me to Eton.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To Eton?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, mother; don’t you understand?”</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>Here a retrospect is necessary to enable the reader
to comprehend the above conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thirty-five years previously there had been born to
a young widow in the Midland Counties of England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a posthumous child and daughter, to whom the name
of Speranza had been given. The widow, Mrs. de
Lara by name, was left badly off. Her husband, who
had been an officer in the British service, had sold out,
and accepted an estate agency from a rich relative, upon
whose property he lived in a tiny but snug cottage,
which nestled amidst some pine and oak woods on the
shores of as beautiful a lake as was to be seen all the
country round. Captain and Mrs. de Lara were a very
happy pair. Theirs had been a love match; and she
never regretted the rich offers of marriage which she
had rejected for the sake of the handsome, dashing
but well-nigh penniless young officer. Her father,
furious at what he considered a <i><span lang="fr">mésalliance</span></i>, had cut
her off with a shilling; and thus it was that the two
had had a hard struggle to make ends meet on the
little possessed by the captain. What mattered it?
They were happy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grief, however, soon came to cloud that home of
peace and contentment. An accidental discharge of
his gun inflicted on Captain de Lara a mortal wound.
He died in the arms of his heart-broken wife, who
lived just long enough to give birth to the little
Speranza, dying a fortnight later, and leaving, penniless
and friendless, two little boys and the baby girl
referred to. The captain’s rich relative adopted them.
He was a kind-hearted man, and felt that he could
not turn them adrift on the world, but his wife, a hard-hearted
and scheming woman, resented the adoption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>bitterly, and led the children a sad and unhappy life.
She had a son and daughter of her own, aged respectively
five and six years, and upon these she lavished
a false and mistaken affection, spoiling them in every
possible way, and bringing them up to be anything
but pleasant to those around them.</p>

<p class='c008'>When old enough Speranza’s brothers were sent to
school, and given to understand by their adopted
father that they might choose their own professions.
The eldest selected the army, the youngest the navy,
and each made a start in his respective line of life.
But Speranza, being a girl, had no chances thrown out
to her. She was a very beautiful girl, strong, healthy,
and clever; but of what use were any of these attributes
to her?</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I were only a boy,” she would bitterly moan
to herself, “I could make my way in the world. I
could work for my living, and be free instead of being
what I am, the butt of my adopted mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is necessary to explain that Speranza’s adopted
parents were the Earl and Countess of Westray, and
that their two children were Bertrand Viscount Altai
and Lady Lucy Maree. Dordington Court was the
family seat, and it was here that Speranza spent the
first sixteen years of her life.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were great doings at Dordington Court when
Lord Altai came of age. A large party was invited to
take part in the week’s festivities, and duly assembled
for the occasion. Many beautiful women were there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>but none could compare in beauty with Speranza de
Lara. She was only seventeen years of age at the
time, but already the promise of exquisite loveliness
could not but be apparent to every one. It captivated
many, but none more so than young Altai himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was not a good man was the young viscount.
Injudicious indulgence as a child had laid the seeds of
selfishness and indifference to the feelings of others.
He had been so accustomed to have all he wanted,
that such a word as “refusal” was hardly known to him.
He had grown up in the belief that what Altai asked
for must be granted as a matter of course. And now,
in pursuit of his passions, he chose to think himself,
or imagined himself, in love with Speranza, and had
determined to make her his wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>He chose his opportunity for asking her. It was
the night of a great ball given at Dordington Court
during the week’s festivities. Speranza had been
dancing with him, and when the dance was over he
led her away into one of the beautiful conservatories
that opened from one of the reception-rooms, and was
lighted up with softly subdued pink fairy lamps.
He thought he had never seen her look more beautiful,
and his passion hungered to make her his own more
than ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>He put the usual question, a question which—no
reason has yet been given why—a man arrogates to
himself <em>alone</em> to put. He never dreamed that she,
the penniless Speranza de Lara, the adopted orphan of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>his father and mother, would refuse <em>him</em>. He took it
as of course for granted that she would jump at his
offer. Were there not girls—and plenty too—in the
house who would have given their eyes for such a
proposal? He put the question therefore confidently,
nay, even negligently, and awaited the answer without
a doubt in his mind as to what it would be.</p>

<p class='c008'>He started. She was speaking in reply. Could he
believe his ears, and was that answer No? And yet
there was no mistaking it, for the voice, though low,
was clear and very distinct. It decidedly said him
Nay. Yes, Speranza had refused him. It was the
first rebuff he had ever received in his life, the first
denial that had ever been made to request of his. It
staggered him, filled him with blind, almost ungovernable,
fury. More than ever he coveted the girl who
had rejected him, more than ever he determined to
make her, what the law told him she should be if he
married her, his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>He left her suddenly, anger and rage at heart, and
she, with a sad and weary restlessness upon her,
wandered out into the clear moonlit night, and stood
gazing over the beautiful lake at her feet, and at the
tiny cottage at the far end where her father and
mother had died, and where she had been born.</p>

<p class='c008'>What was it that stood in Speranza’s eyes? Tears,
large and clear as crystals, were falling from them,
and sobs shook her graceful upright frame, as she
stood with her hands clasped to her forehead in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>agony of grief. Only seventeen, poor child, and yet
so miserable! It was a cruel sight for any one to see.
But no one saw it save the pale moon and twinkling
stars that looked down calmly and sweetly on the
sobbing girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>A harsh voice sounded suddenly at her elbow, a
rough grasp was laid upon her arm. With a cry in
which loathing and horror were mixed Speranza turned
round, only to confront the contemptuous, haughty
woman, who had never said a kind or nice word to her
in all her life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How dare you, girl, behave like this?” had cried
the countess furiously. “How dare you so answer my
darling boy, who has thus condescended to honour you
with his love?”</p>

<p class='c008'>In vain the miserable child had striven to explain
to the infuriated woman that she did not care for
Lord Altai. Such an explanation had only aggravated
the countess’s anger, who, after many and various
threats, had declared that unless Speranza consented
to gratify her darling boy’s passion, she would induce
the earl to deprive Speranza’s two brothers of their
allowances, and therefore of their professions, which, in
other words, meant ruin to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was a clever woman was Lady Westray. She
knew exactly where to strike to gain her end. The
threat which she threw out about Speranza’s two
brothers she knew pretty well would take effect; for
did she not also know that out to them the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>child’s whole heart had gone? Rather than injure
them, the girl determined to sacrifice herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>A month later a great wedding took place. Envied
of all who saw her, Speranza de Lara became
Viscountess Altai, and the wife of the man whom she
detested and loathed. Sold by the law which declares
that however brutally a man may treat his wife, so
that he does not strike her, she has no power to free
herself from him; sold by the law which declares
her to be that man’s slave, this woman, bright with
the glory of a high intellect, perfect in Nature’s health
and strength, was committed to the keeping of a man
whom Fashion courted and patted on the back, whilst
declaring him at the same time to be the veriest <i><span lang="fr">roué</span></i>
in London. <em>He</em> could go and do as <em>he</em> pleased;
indulge in brutal excess, pander to every hideous
passion of his heart, poison with his vile touch the
beautiful creature whom he looked down upon as
“only a woman”; but <em>she</em>, if <em>she</em> dared to overstep
the line of propriety, and openly declare her love for
another, she would be doomed to social ostracism,
shunned and despised as a wanton, and out of the pale
of decent society.</p>

<p class='c008'>She did so dare! For six long years she bore with
his brutal excess and depraved passions; for six
long years she suffered the torture which only those
who have so suffered can understand. Then she
succumbed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a dark November evening when she met her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>fate. The Altais were in Scotland, entertaining a
party of friends for the covert shooting in Lord
Westray’s splendid Wigtownshire preserves. The
guests had all arrived but one, and he put in an
appearance when the remainder of the party had gone
upstairs to dress for dinner. Lady Altai had waited
for him, as he was momentarily expected, and on his
arrival he had been ushered into the drawing-room.
His name was Harry Kintore, a captain in a smart
marching regiment. As she entered the drawing-room
he was standing with his back to the fire, and their
eyes met. Right through her ran a thrill, she knew
not why or wherefore, while he, transfixed by her
beauty, could not remove his eyes. There have been
such cases before of love at first sight. This was
a case about which there could be no dispute; both
felt it was so, both knew it to be beyond recall.</p>

<p class='c008'>How she struggled against her fate none can tell.
With her husband’s increased brutality the gentleness
and devotion of young Kintore was all the more <i><span lang="fr">en
evidence</span></i>. And when at length he bade her fly with
him beyond the reach of so much misery and cruelty,
was it a wonder that she succumbed, and flew in the
face of the law that bound her to the contrary?</p>

<p class='c008'>She left him, that cruel brute, who had made her
life a desert and a hell. She left him for one who
to her was chivalrous and tender, loving and sympathetic.
The world cried shame upon her, and spoke
of Lord Altai as an injured man; the world ostracised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>her while it courted anew the fiend who had so grievously
wronged her. And when, in the hunger of his
baffled passion, this pampered <em>roué</em> followed the two
who had fled from him, and with cold-blooded cruelty
shot dead young Harry Kintore, the world declared
it could not blame him, and that it served Lady Altai
right.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Good-morning, my dear,” exclaims Lady
Manderton, as she enters the cosy boudoir of
her bosom friend and confidante, Mrs. de Lacy Trevor,
as this latter, in a neat <i><span lang="fr">peignoir</span></i>, lies stretched out, novel
in hand, on an easy couch overlooking the fast-filling
street of Piccadilly about eleven o’clock on the morning
of the 5th June, 1890.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ciel! my dear, what brings you here, and dressed,
too, at this unearthly hour?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Chute, Vivi, don’t talk so loud. A mere rencontre,
that’s all. Arthur and I have arranged a little lark,
and I told him to meet me here. I knew you wouldn’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He, he!” giggles Vivi; “but what have you done
with Man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! he’s safe enough, my dear. Gone off to his
club. Thinks I’ve gone to get a gown tried on. He,
he! What fools men are!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think themselves deuced clever, nevertheless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Dodo,” laughs Vivi. “It’s not an hour since Trebby
was raving at me, laying down the law at the way I
go on with Captain Kilmarnock. Of course I pretended
to be awfully cut up, rubbed my eyes, got up
a few tears and sniffs, got rid of him with a kiss or
two, packed him off to his club, and at twelve o’clock
Kil and I are off to Maidenhead together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This announcement creates the greatest amusement
between the two ladies, judging by the peals of laughter
that follow it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By-the-bye, Dodo, where were you yesterday?”
inquires Vivi Trevor, after the laughter has subsided.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I, my dear? Why, I was with H.R.H.’s party
for the 4th of June. You can’t think what a jolly
day we had, Vivi. Some of the recitations were quite
delightful, and there was a boy called Hector
D’Estrange, who was simply too lovely for words.
We all fell in love with him, I can tell you. I never
saw such eyes in my life. Won’t he break some of
our hearts some day!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hector D’Estrange; but who is he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just what every one was asking, but no one
seemed to know. It appears he has taken the school
by storm. Does everything tiptop. Splendid batsman,
bowler, oarsman, wonderful at racquets, undefeatable
at books—in fact, my dear, beautiful as an
Adonis, and clever past expression.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Dodo! I must see this Adonis. I love pretty
boys.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“And plucky ones, too,” laughs Vivi. “I was
speaking to young Estcourt, who is his chum, and he
told me that when Hector D’Estrange first came to
Eton, a good many attempts were made to bully him,
but he soon settled his tormentors, and gave one of
them, a big overgrown monster, such a drubbing, that
he never molested him more. What fun, Dodo, it
would have been to see my Adonis punching the
overgrown bully! I did laugh when Estcourt told
me. I do so hate overgrown boys. Don’t you, Dodo?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I do, Vivi. Detest them!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a ring at the door bell. Vivi jumps up
and looks out of the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Arthur!” is all she exclaims.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, ta ta, Vivi! won’t bother you with him,”
laughs Lady Manderton, as she stoops to kiss her
friend. “See you to-night, I suppose, at Ferdey’s—eh?
Love to Kil. Don’t let Trebby catch you, and a pleasant
outing to you both;” saying which she is off out of
the room, and running downstairs to meet her friend
Sir Arthur Muster-Day, a smart young guardsman,
whom it has pleased her for the time being to think
that she likes better than any one else in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are off together, happy in each other’s company.
Sir Arthur is not married, and he thinks it just
the thing to be seen about as much as possible in the
company of one of London’s newest belles. Lady
Manderton doesn’t care a rap for her husband, and is
considerably bored that her husband evinces a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>amount of affection for her; she only married him for
his money and position, and did not at all bargain for
the affection part of the affair.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for Vivi, after her friend is gone, she jumps up
and rings for her maid. That important individual
having made her appearance, she and Vivi are soon
engrossed with the all-paramount question of the
moment—dress. Half-a-dozen gowns are pulled out,
put on, pulled off and discarded, until at length one
appears to please more than the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you think I look in this, Marie?” she
inquires a little anxiously. “Is it becoming?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mais, madame, c’est tout-à-fait charmante,” replies
the well-drilled maid with an expression of
admiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vivi is satisfied. The gown remains on her person,
and in a short time she is dressed and ready for
her day’s outing. Twelve o’clock strikes. A neat
brougham dashes up to the door. In less time almost
than it takes to tell it, Vivi has taken her seat in the
carriage, and is being whirled through the busy streets
of London, <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> to Captain Kilmarnock’s rooms.
There she will pick him up, and together they will
proceed to Maidenhead, what to do God knows. We
had better leave them.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few minutes later, and there is another ring at the
door, and the footman opens it to Mr. de Lacy Trevor.
As he does so, the latter inquires—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Mrs. Trevor in?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“No, sir, just gone out,” answers the servant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know where to, James?” again asks
Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not, sir, but perhaps Mademoiselle Marie will
know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Marie is called, and arrives all smiles and bows.
“Really, she thinks madame has gone out for a drive
with her friend Lady Manderton, and to lunch with
her afterwards. <i><span lang="fr">C’est tout.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Trevor sighs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There will be no lunch wanted, James,” he observes
quietly. “I shall lunch at the club.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He wanders down the street in the direction of
St. James’s. He wonders if Vivi has forgotten the
promise she made him that morning to lunch at home,
and go for a ride with him afterwards. He so rarely
sees her now, and when he does it is seldom alone.
She never seems to have any time to give to him, and
yet he is not brutal to her, or neglectful, or wrapped
up in some one else, as many other men are. He loves
her so dearly, and would do anything to make her
happy; but he can quite see how she shuns him, and
how much happier she looks when in Captain Kilmarnock’s
company. And then, with a shudder, he starts
and stares eagerly across the street, for there she is—yes,
actually there she is, in Captain Kilmarnock’s
brougham, with the captain beside her, driving
rapidly in the direction of Piccadilly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Trevor has a strange lump in his throat as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>ascends the steps of the Conservative and enters that
roomy club.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waiter!” he calls out, and his voice is somewhat
husky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bring me a stiff brandy-and-soda, waiter, and
mind it <em>is</em> stiff,” continues Mr. Trevor, as he throws
himself wearily into a chair. The soda with its stiff
complement of brandy arrives. It is mixed carefully
by the waiter, and handed to the sad-hearted man.
He drinks it eagerly. He has not a strong head, and
knows that he cannot take much, but he feels that
oblivion must in this instance be sought, if possible,
no matter how, so long as it is attained.</p>

<p class='c008'>The brandy, in a measure, has the desired effect.
He feels it perforating through his body and mounting
to his brain. Things don’t look quite so gloomy to
him now, and the loneliness of his position is less
acutely felt. Two men are talking to each other close
by him. He knows one of them. It is Sir Ralph
Vereton, and he holds in his hand a copy of the June
number of the <cite>Free Review</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a wonderful article for a boy to write, and
an Eton boy, too,” he hears the baronet exclaiming.
“Have you read it, Critchley?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, no, I can’t say that I have, but I will, old
chap, when I get home. I’m afraid I haven’t time to
just now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that, Vereton?” inquires Mr. Trevor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>leaning forward in his chair, “anything particularly
clever?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hulloa, Trevor! you there? Didn’t see you, old
man. What! you haven’t read an Eton boy’s ‘Essay
on Woman’s Position’? Every one is talking about
it. It’s deuced clever and original, whatever one may
think of the opinions, and is clearly written by a lad
who will make his mark in the world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s have a look at it, Vereton, if you don’t want
it, there’s a good chap. I want something to read,”
exclaims Mr. Trevor eagerly, reaching out his hand
for the periodical, which the baronet passes to him
good-naturedly. It is open at the page of honour, the
first page in the book, and as Mr. Trevor scans the
heading he reads it as follows: “Woman’s Position
in this World. By Hector D’Estrange, an Eton boy.”
He starts reading it, languidly at first, as if the
remarks of a boy on such a subject cannot possibly be
worth reading, but he is soon absorbed in the article,
and never budges in his chair until he has read it
through and through.</p>

<p class='c008'>And there are some parts to which he turns again
and again, as though he would burn their truths into
his brain, and keep them there never to be forgotten.
One in especial rivets his attention, so much so that
he commits it to memory.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When a girl is born,” it ran, “no especial difference
is made in the care of her by doctor or nurse. Up
to a certain age the treatment which she and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>brother receive is exactly the same. Why, I ask,
should there be ever any change in this treatment?
Why should such a marked contrast be drawn later
on between the sexes? Is it for the good of either
that the girl should be both physically and mentally
stunted, both in her intellect and body,—that she
should be held back while the boy is pressed forward?
Can it be argued with any show of reason that her
capacity for study is less, and her power of observation
naturally dwarfed in comparison with that of
the boy? Certainly not. I confidently assert that
where a girl has fair play, and is given equal opportunities
with the boy, she not only equals him in
mental capacity, but far outruns him in such; and I
also confidently assert, that given the physical opportunities
afforded to the boy, to develop and expand,
and strengthen the body by what are called ‘manly
exercises,’ the girl would prove herself every inch his
equal in physical strength. There are those, I know,
who will sneer at these opinions, but in the words of
Lord Beaconsfield, I can only asseverate that ‘the
time will come,’ when those who sneer will be forced
to acknowledge the truth of this assertion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well then, granting, for the sake of argument,
that what I have stated is correct, why, I ask, should
all that men look forward to and hold most dear, be
denied to women? Why should the professions which
men have arrogated to themselves be entirely monopolised
by their sex, to the exclusion of women? I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>see no manner of reason why, if women received the
same moral, mental, and physical training that men
do, they should not be as fit—nay, infinitely more
fit—to undertake the same duties and responsibilities
as men. I do not see that we should be a wit less
badly governed if we had a woman Prime Minister or
a mixed Cabinet, or if women occupied seats in the
Houses of Parliament or on the bench in the Courts
of Justice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course woman’s fitness to undertake these duties
depends entirely on the manner in which she is educated.
If you stunt the intellect, tell her nothing, and
refuse to exercise the physical powers which Nature
has given her, you must expect little from such an
unfortunate creature. Put man in the same position
in which yon put woman, and he would be in a very
short time just as mentally and physically stunted as
she is.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All very well to declare that it is a woman’s business
to bear children, to bring them up, to attend to
household matters, and to leave the rest to men. A
high-spirited girl or woman will not, in every instance,
accept this definition of her duties by man as correct.
That such a definition is clearly man’s, it is not difficult
to see, for woman would never have voluntarily condemned
herself to a life of such inert and ambitionless
duties as these. But so long as this definition of
woman’s duty and position be observed and accepted
by Society, so long will this latter be a prey to all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>evils and horrors that afflict it, and which are a result
of woman’s subjection and degradation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think you, you who read these words, that hundreds
of women now unhappily married would ever
have contracted that terrible tie had they been aware
of what they were doing, or had they had the smallest
hope of advancement and prospects of success in life
without? Certainly not. Marriage is contracted in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred by women desirous
of making for themselves a home, and because in no
other quarter can they adopt agreeable and pleasant
professions and occupations like men. Were it possible,
they would either not have married, or at least
have waited until, with the knowledge of man which
they <em>should</em> possess—but which, unfortunately, nowadays
comes to them only with marriage—they could
select for themselves, with their eyes open, a partner
suited to them in every respect. As it is, what does
one see? Women, especially in the higher grades of
society, marry only to escape in many instances the
prim restraints of home. Others marry for money and
position, because they know that the portals, through
which men may pass to try for these, are closed to
them. The cruel laws by which men have shut
women out from every hope of winning name and
fame, are responsible for hundreds of wretched marriages,
which have seared the world with their griefs.
If, in the narrow sphere within which she moves, a
woman errs, let not the man blame her, but rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>look to the abolition of unnatural laws which have
brought about her degradation.”</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Trevor sits very still in his chair. A flood of
thoughts have come to fill his brain. They keep him
very busy and occupied. The revelations thrown upon
woman’s position by the straightforward, truth-breathing
article of Hector D’Estrange, have taken him by
storm, and have completely revolutionised his ideas.
He has hitherto been so accustomed to look upon
and  treat women with the self-satisfied, conscious
feeling of superiority assumed by men, that such ideas
as these before him are startlingly strange and extraordinary.
His position with Vivi, and hers in regard
to him, presents itself now to his mind in a totally
different light to that in which he has hitherto been
accustomed to regard it. He remembers how he first
met her hardly a year ago, a beautiful, lively, healthy
girl, whose scheming mother, knowing no better, had
thrust her into the busy mart, willing to sell her to
the highest bidder. He remembers how passionately
he fell in love with this girl, how he never paused to
ask himself if his love were returned. He recalls full
well the bitter look that had crossed her face when
he had asked her to be his wife, and the cold, matter-of-fact
way in which she had accepted him. Then his
thoughts fly back to his wedding day, and a shudder
runs through Launcelot Trevor as he recalls the utter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>absence of love on her part towards him. And, remembering
all this, he cannot but feel that Hector
D’Estrange is right. If, in the narrow sphere within
which poor Vivi had moved, she had, according to the
notions of propriety laid down by Mrs. Grundy, erred,
Launcelot Trevor feels that the blame must rest not
so much with her, as with the cruel laws that had left
that beautiful girl no other option but to sell herself
for gold; for be it remembered, she had been educated
up to no higher level, been imbued with no better
aim. She had been taught that the only opening for
a girl is to get herself well married, that while men
could go forth into the world with a score of professions
to choose from, she must for ever regard herself
as shut out from that world of enterprise, daring, and
fame, created, so says man, solely for himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sits on in his chair, his thoughts still busy with
the new problem that has presented itself so startlingly
to his mind. The luncheon hour is far past,
much of the afternoon has slipped away, still Launcelot
Trevor remains where he had seated himself many
hours before. Men keep coming in and out; friends
and acquaintances nod to him as they pass. He
scarcely heeds them, or pays attention to what they
say. His mind is absorbed by the truths which he
has faced for the first time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly he starts; the clock is striking seven. He
remembers that at eight o’clock he and Vivi are
engaged to dine out. He jumps up, bids the hall-porter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>hail a hansom, and in a few minutes is being
driven towards Piccadilly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has Mrs. Trevor returned yet?” he again inquires
of the servant who opens the door to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir, she is in the drawing-room with Captain
Kilmarnock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walks slowly upstairs. All is very silent in the
room mentioned. He stands on the threshold, hardly
daring to open the door. He can hear a rustling
inside, and, yes, unmistakably the sound of a kiss.
He coughs audibly as he lays his hand on the door’s
handle. He can hear a scuffling of feet, and on entering
perceives Vivi sitting bolt upright on the sofa,
and Captain Kilmarnock apparently warming his
hands over the fireplace. Unfortunately there is no
fire!</p>

<p class='c008'>She looks at him as he comes in, and for a moment
their eyes meet. A bright flush rises to Vivi’s cheeks.
She expects to see him furious, as he had been that
morning, and is surprised, nay, even awed by the sad
expression on his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vivi,” he says very quietly, “I think we ought to
be dressing for dinner. Good-evening to you, Kilmarnock.
Are you to be at Ferdey’s to-night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Trevor,” stammers the captain, visibly uncomfortable.
“I have another engagement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, well, shall see you again, I suppose, soon?
Good-night, old chap. Must go and dress. Vivi dear,
don’t be late.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>He goes out as he speaks, and closes the door behind
him. Hector D’Estrange’s words are still next his
heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Vivi,” he mutters to himself. “It is not
her fault. Poor Vivi.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He is hardly out of the room, when she looks up at
Captain Kilmarnock. The scared expression is still
in her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kil,” she whispers, “that <em>was</em> a near squeak.
You had better be off, old man. Didn’t hear the front
door bell ring, did you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he answers in a rather sulky tone. “Hang
him! He’s always where he’s not wanted. But you
are right. I’d better be off. To-morrow at three.
Don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” she answers, with a smile.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Always busy and astir, the little town of Melton
Mowbray presents a more than usually busy
aspect on the morning of the 15th April, 1894. It
is early yet, nevertheless the streets ring with the
sound of trotting and cantering hacks, as well as the
more sober paces of the strings of horses returning
from exercise to their respective stables.</p>

<p class='c008'>People are coming and going at a rapid rate.
They nearly all seem to know each other, judging by
the little nods, and “good-mornings,” and suchlike
familiar greetings with which friends meet, and in
which these afore-mentioned personages indulge, as
they hurry by each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>A party of horsemen and horsewomen are just riding
out of the stables belonging to The Limes. They are
laughing and talking merrily. We have seen two of
the women before, and their names are Mrs. de Lacy
Trevor and Lady Manderton. Close in attendance
upon them are two smart good-looking men, whom we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>must introduce to the reader as Lord Charles Dartrey
and the Earl of Westray. The former appears to be
entirely taken up with the first-named lady, the latter—already
introduced to the reader in a former chapter
as Lord Altai—with the last-named one.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is yet another pair in that cheery group that
we must particularly notice. They are a man and
woman, both young, both good-looking, and both unmistakably
at home in the saddle. If one can judge
from appearances, the woman must be about twenty-two
years of age, the man perhaps five or six years
her senior. Both are mounted on grey horses, and
both look every inch what they are, splendid equestrians.
The woman is well known in Society’s world,
as also in the tiny hunting world of Melton. She is
Lady Flora Desmond, and the man is handsome
Captain “Jack” Delamere.</p>

<p class='c008'>They trot through the streets at a merry pace, down
past the Harborough Hotel, over the railway, away on
by Wicklow Lodge, towards Burton Lazarus. It is
a beautiful morning, and the sun is shining brightly on
the flats that lie below. Dalby Hall, nestling amidst
its woods on the far hillside, stands out distinct and
clear, with the same bright sun gleaming on its gables
and windows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a glorious morning, Jack!” exclaims Lady
Flora enthusiastically. “Why, it’s like summer, is it
not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The others are a little on ahead, and these two have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>fallen in the rear. Jack looks at the speaker with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a grand day, Florrie, and it suits you, too. I
never saw you looking better in my life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She flushes up. Florrie Desmond does not care
about compliments,—she values them at their worth,—but
she and Jack are fast friends, and she is not quite
averse to them from him. She answers, however.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shut up, you goose, and don’t talk nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She is a clever woman is Flora Desmond, cleverer
far than some people take her to be. Her bringing
up has not been exactly like other women’s, and she
has always kicked against the restraints and restrictions
put upon her sex. She is the daughter of the
Marquis and Marchioness of Douglasdale, and an
orphan, having lost her father at an early age. Lady
Douglasdale was, in her day, a very beautiful woman,
a <i><span lang="la">persona grata</span></i> at Court, where her husband exercised
the duties of Comptroller of the Household, and was a
favourite with his sovereign; but after the marquis’s
death she took greatly to travelling, and thus it was
that Flora Ruglen, in conjunction with her twin
brother Archie, saw most of the great world of
Europe before she was ten years of age.</p>

<p class='c008'>Travelling expands the mind, and brightens the
senses. It had this effect upon the girl, forming much
of her character before its time. At that early age
she exhibited peculiar characteristics. No one could
get her to settle down to study under a governess; she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>loathed the sight of school books, and led her unfortunate
preceptors a sad life; yet, in strange
contradiction to so much wilfulness and apparent
indolence, she was seldom without the companionship
of a book in her play hours, and when not otherwise
engaged with her brother, would invariably be found
poring over these books, thirstily seeking knowledge,
or committing to paper, in powerful language
for one so young, the impressions of her youthful
brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had dreams had Flora Ruglen—dreams of a
bright future, an adventurous career. The time had
not arrived when the road which she and her twin
brother had been pursuing, would branch off in
different directions, his leading forth to opportunities
of power, fame, and glory, hers along a lane, narrow
and cramped, and with nothing to seek at the end,
save that against which her bright independent spirit
rebelled and revolted. But it came at last, when the
companion of her happy childhood’s days was taken
from her, when Archie was sent to school, and she
was left alone. It came upon her with a suddenness
which she found difficult to realise, and the blow was
terrible. To describe what she suffered would be well-nigh
impossible. Only those who by experience have
learnt it, could be brought to understand the horror
of her position. But Flora Ruglen, having faced it,
brought all the courage of her nature to support it,
though from that moment she became utterly changed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>She had no one in whom to confide; neither her
mother nor any one else would have understood her.
With girls of her own age she had nothing in
common, and they looked on her with awe as a proud,
stuck-up being. None could guess at the warm heart
that beat beneath Flora Ruglen’s apparently cold and
reserved demeanour—except one, and that one was a
boy of about her own age.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had made his acquaintance during the holidays,
when Archie, home from school, had invited his “best
pal” to spend them at Ruglen Manor, the beautiful
dower property of Lady Douglasdale. It was with
young Lord Estcourt that Archie Douglasdale had
struck up so keen a friendship. The lads had been
“new boys” at Eton together, and in the first
strangeness of introduction to that boy’s world had
been thrown into each other’s company a good deal,
being in the same house, and, as in Flora’s case, much
of the same age.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Estcourt came to Ruglen Manor Flora
Ruglen was about seventeen years of age. She was
interested in her brother’s friend, inasmuch as he had
lately lost his mother, and was an orphan. It did not
take long for a firm friendship to spring up between
the boy and girl. Nigel Estcourt was an only child,
had never known what it was to have brothers and
sisters, and was ready to look upon Flora in that
light gladly enough. He and she were a great deal in
each other’s company, and for the first time in her life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>she unloosed the cords of her heart, and told him of
the trouble that had descended upon her life.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sympathised with her did young Nigel. How
could he help it, being, as he was, the friend of Hector
D’Estrange? That extraordinary boy had risen to be
head of the school. None could equal him at Eton,
and his name had gone forth beyond the portals of the
college as the coming man of his day. The article in
the <cite>Free Review</cite>, which had first brought his name into
prominence in the year 1890, had created a good deal
of discussion in many circles. Of course it had been
vigorously attacked. What great stroke aimed at
Justice and Freedom but has ever been so opposed,
hounded down, and decried? But truth is like a
bright sun which no mortal power can dim. It may
be clouded for a time, but it must shine forth and
ultimately prevail.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had left Eton, gone to Oxford, and had there
taken high honours. He no sooner made his appearance
in the world of fashion, politics, and letters, than
he was received and courted everywhere. Never before
had a youth risen so rapidly in the scale of success.
He was undoubtedly the idol of his day, and in
1894 only twenty-one. It was extraordinary. Hector
D’Estrange would marvel often at it himself. He had
gone out into the world in what was mere childhood,
prepared to combat with the many difficulties which he
knew must beset his path. He was over modest was
this boy. He had not sufficiently estimated his great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and surpassing genius, but it had shone forth, been
recognised and approved of, because he was a man.</p>

<p class='c008'>To return to Flora Ruglen. At the age of eighteen
she lost her mother, and the guardianship of the girl
devolved on her aunt, a giddy, worldly woman, the
late marquis’s sister, and Countess of Dunderfield. No
two women could have been more diametrically
opposite then these two, no two characters more unlike.
Briefly, and to cut the matter short, Lady
Dunderfield insisted on taking Flora into Society, and
set herself to bring about a match between the high-souled,
high-spirited girl, and the Duke of Dovetail,
a rich old monstrosity, whose rent-roll was nigh on a
million, and whose body was afflicted by almost every
disease under the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>Had the girl been in a position to map out her own
line of life, what a different tale might now be told!
She was not. The law denied her the right to choose
her future; it curtailed her line of action within certain
bounds. What could she do? The odds were against
her, and she sought refuge through the first outlet that
presented itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>This outlet was in the shape of a young baronet, a
youth of twenty-one. He thought himself very much
in love with Lady Flora Ruglen. He proposed, and
she accepted him. Lady Dunderfield forbade Sir
Reginald Desmond the house. The young people
took French leave of her, fled to Scotland, and were
married, and Lady Dunderfield, green with disappointment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and rage, had to accept the fact. This is how
Flora Ruglen became Lady Flora Desmond. Had
she erred in the step she took? Perhaps so. What
other alternative had she? Had the law permitted
her to go out into the world and adopt the profession
of her choice, there is little doubt that ere this Flora
Ruglen would have made a great name for good.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>He pretends to be offended at her remark does
Jack Delamere, and pulls his horse a little away from
her own. She notices the movement, and laughs
lightly, as she urges her animal alongside him, and
taps him gently on the shoulder with her whip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look there, Jack!” she exclaims at the same
time; “we are not the first on the course after all.
Look at those two riding over the fence alongside the
brook. Who are they, I wonder? The woman can
ride, it is easy enough to see that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They are just turning to the left through the gate
leading to the Steeplechase Course on the Burton
Flats, and as Jack Delamere’s eyes follow the
direction indicated by Flora Desmond, he at once
perceives two mounted figures, galloping up the
course in the direction of the grand stand. One is a
man, the other a woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Flora Desmond has declared, the woman can
ride. She sits her horse straight as a dart. He is
pulling a bit, but she has him well in hand, and he is
not likely to get away with her.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Hector D’Estrange, by all that’s holy! and with
a woman, too,” laughs Jack Delamere. “Look,
Florrie! Is the world coming to an end, or am I
dreaming?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That you are certainly not,” she answers quickly;
“there is no mistake about it. But who is she?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They have joined the others now, and find them
equally exercised over the female apparition.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be explained that this is the morning of the
Melton Hunt Steeplechases, and that this party has
ridden over early to the course to go round the fences,
and inspect them severally. They had bargained on
being the first in the field, but now perceive that they
have been forestalled by Hector D’Estrange and his
companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go and have a look,” suggests Lord Westray.
He is an admirer of women, and it is easy to perceive,
even at the distance which separates the party from
the stranger, that she is a fine one.</p>

<p class='c008'>They all gallop down to the stand, riding along in
a row towards Hector and his friend. He sees them
coming, and says something to her, and Flora notices
that she brings her horse closer to his side. Mrs.
Trevor and Lady Manderton are all eyes and stare
as they pass the two. Hector has raised his hat
politely, and wished them a good-morning. His face
is flushed with the exercise of riding, his rich auburn
hair shines out like gold in the sunlight, his glorious
eyes, dark in their sapphire-blue, look particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>winning and beautiful. But it is with his companion
that the eyes of the others are busy. They are all
struck by her extreme loveliness, and are loud in
wonder as to who she is. Only Lord Westray is
silent; white as a sheet, too. It is years since he set
eyes on Lady Altai, and now he sees again, after a
long lapse of time, the woman whom he so grievously
wronged more than twenty-two years before—his
divorced wife, Speranza de Lara.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on,” he exclaims, just a shade roughly to
Lady Manderton. He has of late been, by the way,
making up to her. She has got tired of Sir Arthur
Muster-Day, and has shelved him for the “wicked
earl,” by which name Lord Westray is known in
Society circles. Mrs. Trevor, too, though she still
sticks to Kil, and makes him believe that she is as
devoted to him as ever, has managed to hook on to
herself several other devoted swains, to all of whom
in turn she expresses a mint of devotion, while really
feeling not the slightest affection for any of them.
She has played her part well, however, for they each
severally believe themselves to be “<em>the</em> favoured man”
in her good graces.</p>

<p class='c008'>They gallop forward in the wake of Lord Westray,
and Flora Desmond and Jack Delamere are once more
alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a lovely woman!” she bursts out, as soon
as they have passed Hector D’Estrange and Speranza.
“Jack, did you ever see such eyes? I never saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>lovelier, unless perhaps Hector D’Estrange’s. What
a handsome pair the two make!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, yes, Florrie, she is certainly a lovely woman.
Cunning dog, young Hector, to have kept her out of
sight so long. Now we can understand why he is so
cold to women. Of course that’s where his heart is,
without doubt,” answers Jack Delamere, with a smile.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>“The Melton Hunt Steeplechases of 1894 are over.
The meeting will long be remembered by the unparalleled
success of Mr. Hector D’Estrange, who,
riding in the six races printed on the card for competition,
came in first, the winner of every one of them.
This success is all the more remarkable, inasmuch as
four of the winners were non-favourites, so that the
wins must be ascribed to the splendid horsemanship
of their jockey. The feat is unparalleled, the nearest
approach to it being when Captain ‘Doggie’ Smith in
1880 carried off all the races on the card except one,
being defeated in a match which closed the day’s
proceedings between Lord Hastings’ Memory, and
Lord James Douglas’ The General. In this match
‘Doggie’ Smith rode Lord Hastings’ mare, and Lord
James Douglas his own horse, The General.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such is the announcement chronicled in a well-known
weekly sporting paper a few days after the
Melton Hunt Steeplechases of 1894, scoring yet
another triumph on the path of thoroughness for
Hector D’Estrange.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>
<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“So you will not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A thousand times, no!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They are standing facing each other are the speakers—one
a beautiful, tall, graceful woman, with masses
of rich gold hair coiled upon her noble head, and eyes
whose light is like the turquoise gem, the other a
middle-sized, handsome, good-looking man, whose
dark eyes gleam with fury and disappointed passion.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have seen them both before, this man and
woman, seen them on more than one occasion; for it
is not difficult to recognise in that evil-featured man
the person of Lord Westray, or in that beautiful
woman that of Speranza de Lara.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has come here for no good purpose has the
“wicked earl.” Ever since, on the Burton Flats, he
had fallen across the lovely woman whose life he had
made a desert, Lord Westray had been a prey to a
consuming passion to regain that which he had lost.
Twice in her life Speranza had defied him, and on
each occasion he had had his revenge. The first was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>when, as a girl of seventeen, she had refused him, and
he, through the instrumentality of his cruel mother,
who had played on her love for her brothers, had
forced her to become his wife. The second was when,
in defiance of man’s laws, she had fled from his vile
brutality and hateful presence, with the first and last
love of her young life, poor Harry Kintore; and he,
following up those two to the sunny land where they
had sought a refuge, and where they asked for no
other boon but to be allowed to live with and for each
other, had shot down in her very presence the man
to save whom she would have given a thousand lives
of her own.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now he is here, oblivious of all his past brutality,
to insult her with yet another proposal, one
more hideous than any he has ever made before. Consumed
with passion for this woman, who had defied
him, he has actually come to propose that she shall
forget the past and re-marry him!</p>

<p class='c008'>Forget the past! Is it likely? Will the memory
of her suffering childhood ever pass away? Will the
recollection of her wedding day fade from her mind?
Will the six years of torture as his wedded wife disappear
like a dream? Above all, can she ever forget
her first meeting with Harry Kintore, the heart’s
awakening that came with it, or the terrible moment
when, struck down at her feet, his dear eyes looked
their love for the last time? Impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>He grinds his teeth with rage does Lord Westray
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>as her clear, sad voice distinctly gives him his answer.
He is racking his brain for a means of overcoming her,
and forcing her once more to obey his will. The fact
that she defies him, hates him, loathes him, has
refused him, only arouses in him more madly than
ever the desire to become possessed of her once again.
Lord Westray possesses, in a heightened degree, in
an aggravated form, the characteristic peculiar to all
men, of desiring that which is either hard to get, or
which denies itself to them, and which, if once obtained,
fades in value in their eyes. It is Speranza’s resistance
to his wishes that fires him with the fury of a
wild animal to regain her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You shall repent this!” he mutters angrily.
“Speranza, you should know better than to defy <em>me</em>.
Have I not been a match for you twice? and, by God!
if you do not do as I ask now I will be again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shudders with horror as she hears his cold-blooded
words, triumphing at his past deeds of brutality
and crime. She pulls herself together, however.
She is alone with him, and must keep him at bay.
Speranza is no coward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not fear you,” she answers haughtily; “you
cannot do me more evil than you have already. I am
beyond the reach of your vengeance now. Nothing
<em>you</em> can do can harm <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know so much about that,” he replies
savagely. “How about Hector D’Estrange?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She starts, and the rich blood flushes to her face as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>she eyes him with evident terror. Can it be that he
knows, that he will unveil the secret before—but
no, it is impossible; she has it safe enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>He notes the start, the crimson blush, and the look
of terror, and he congratulates himself on having, by
a chance shot, hit on the right point to cow her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a fine person to play the prude and the
proper,” he says, with a sneer. “They used to tell
me that you were inconsolable over that ass Kintore,
but the beauty of Hector D’Estrange appears to have
effected a sudden cure. I congratulate you on your
new conquest. You have aimed high. He is the
rising man of his day, and you have thrown your net
well to catch the golden fish. Are you not ashamed
of yourself, however, woman,—you who are over the
forties, to take up with a boy of twenty-one?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She flushes again. Then he does not know? Thank
God for that! How young she looks as she stands
there in her unfading beauty, with a look in her blue
eyes of contemptuous loathing. She will let him
believe what he likes, so that he does not know the
truth; that is all she desires to hide from him.</p>

<p class='c008'>In pursuance of this desire she answers:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hector D’Estrange and I <em>are</em> friends. I am not
ashamed to own it. Neither he nor I require your
advice, however, as to how our friendship is to be conducted.
And now I bid you leave me. I order you
from my house, which I inhabit not by your charity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but by the charity of Harry Kintore, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>wanton!” he answers with an oath. “You knew pretty
well what you were about when you got the fool to
settle all his estates and money on you, which you
now lavish on Hector D’Estrange, but——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Peace, devil! fiend in human shape!” she cries
furiously, as she clenches her hands, and brings the
right one down with a crash on the table beside her.
He notices a flash on one of the fingers. All the
others are ringless but this one, and on it sparkles
two splendid diamonds and sapphires set deep in their
broad thick band of gold. He knows this ring of old.
He saw it long ago, when she held the dying head of
Harry Kintore in her hands, and he knows that it was
the young man’s gift to her. That she should wear it,
now that she has taken up with Hector D’Estrange,
mystifies him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is about to reply, when the door of the room
they are in opens, and Lord Westray finds himself
face to face with Hector. He is a head and shoulders
taller than the earl is this young man, and as he
advances into the room the latter’s face falls slightly,
and his fingers move nervously by his side. Like all
bullies, Lord Westray is a coward, and doesn’t half
fancy his position.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there is no angry look in Hector D’Estrange’s
eyes; only from their sapphire depths looks out a
cold, calm expression of contempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord Westray,” he remarks, in a voice impressive
because of its very quietness, “for what reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>have we the honour of your presence here? Allow
me to inform you that this honour is not desired by
Mrs. de Lara. Your brougham is at the door. I must
request you to seek it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He says no more, but stands with the handle of the
door in his hand, waiting for the earl to obey. This
latter looks at him fiercely, the eyes of the two meet.
Those of the bully and depraved coward cannot face
the calm, disdainful look of Hector D’Estrange; they
fall before it, and in another moment the earl is gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>They listen to the wheels of the departing brougham
as it rattles through the streets in the direction of
South Kensington. As its echoes die away the young
man turns to Speranza.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mother,” he exclaims, “has he been here to insult
you? Ah, mother! God only knows the strain I put
upon myself, or I would have shot him down where
he stood, the brute, the fiend! I nearly lost control
of myself, but I heard your last words, and understood
what you were striving to hide from him. Thank
God I did, or in a hasty moment I might have laid
bare our secret.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I, too, say thank God, Gloria. At one
moment I fancied he was in possession of it, but I
quickly found out that he was on another tack.
Horrible as the idea was, it was better to let him
foster it, than to give him a chance of learning the
truth. Ah, Gloria dearest! if once the secret is in
his hands, we need look for no mercy in that quarter.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“I know it, mother,” answers Gloria, in other words
Hector D’Estrange; for the reader must have had no
difficulty in recognising in this latter, the beautiful
girl who had made her vow to the wild sea waves,
ten years previously on the sunny shores of the Adriatic,
and who now, as Hector D’Estrange, is working out the
accomplishment of that vow.</p>

<p class='c008'>And she has worked well has Gloria de Lara,
patiently and perseveringly, never losing an opportunity,
never casting a chance aside. Her beauty and
her genius have gone straight to the hearts of men,
and she uses these gifts given her by God, not for vain
glory and fleeting popularity, but in pursuit of justice
and in furtherance of the one great aim of her life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us change the subject, my darling,” exclaims
Speranza, with a shudder; “let us drive from our
minds the thought of one so horrible and contemptible.
Tell me, my precious child,” she continues, laying her
hand on Gloria’s shoulder, and kissing her gently on
the forehead, “how have you got on with the clubs
to-day?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Excellently, mother. I came to tell you all about
them, or I should not have been here until to-morrow,”
answers Gloria, as she seats herself on a low stool at
her mother’s feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the middle of May, the sun is shining brightly,
and the sparrows are hopping and chirping merrily
about in the square outside. The early green on the
trees is as yet unclouded by the dust of London’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>busy season, and all is fair, and soft, and young to
look upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The large fortune and noble estates left to Speranza
de Lara by young Harry Kintore have been well and
wisely wielded by the woman, in whose heart the
memory of her darling still shines as brightly as on
the day he died. She has never misspent a farthing
of the vast wealth that he confided to her care. It
has been used in carrying out philanthropic works,
alleviating suffering, and helping on the accomplishment
of their child’s design, his child and hers.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are busy over a new one just now. With her
mother’s money at her command, Gloria, under the
name of Hector D’Estrange, is establishing throughout
London, and in the different large towns of Great
Britain and Ireland, institutions where women and
girls can meet each other, and for a mere nominal fee
learn to ride, to shoot with gun and rifle, to swim, to
run, and to indulge in the invigorating influences of
gymnastics and other exercises, calculated to strengthen
and improve the physique of those taking part therein.
Classes, too, technical and otherwise, for the education
of girls and women on an equality with boys and men,
as well as free libraries, form part of these institutions,
each of which, as it is founded, becomes crowded to
overflowing.</p>

<p class='c008'>In connection with these institutions Gloria has
lately set on foot clubs, the members of which she
is forming into volunteer companies, who are drilled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>by the hand of discipline into smartness and efficiency.
The movement has been enthusiastically taken up by
the women of Great Britain and Ireland, thousands of
whom have been enrolled in these volunteer forces.
Of course Hector D’Estrange has his enemies. The
jealous and the narrow-minded; the old fogies who
would have a great wrong continue for ever, rather than
fly in the face of prejudice to right it; the women who
love their degradation and hug their chains; the men
who think the world must be coming to an end if
women are to be acknowledged as their equals, have
all fought tooth and nail against the splendid idea
and the practical conception of Hector D’Estrange.
Ridicule, abuse, calumny, false testimony, have been
hurled against his giant work. They have each and
all failed to disturb or harm it, for its foundation is
built on the rock of justice, of right, and of nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, mother,” continues the girl, “we have had
a great consultation to-day. All the details for a big
review have been discussed. We shall want two good
years more to get everything efficiently arranged, when
I calculate that Hector D’Estrange will be able to
bring into the field quite 100,000 well-drilled troops.
But I am in no hurry yet; there is still much to be
done. And now I have some more news to give you,
mother. I have been invited to stand by the Douglasdale
division of Dumfriesshire for Parliament, and to
contest the seat when Mr. Reform resigns. I saw
Archie Douglasdale to-day; he has promised to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>me all his support. And what do you think, mother?
Why, his sister, Lady Flora Desmond, has joined our
new club. It is to be called the Desmond Lodge, and
I have put her in command of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She will be a great help to you, Gloria,” answers
Speranza. “From all you have told me of her, she
is the right sort in the right place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is indeed, mother. Although I have many
a good and true lieutenant thoroughly in touch with
my ideas in our volunteer force, there is not one that
can come up to Lady Flora. She will be a mountain
of help to me, and I know I can trust her. I could
trust her even with <em>our</em> secret.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! never divulge <em>that</em>, Gloria.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not I, mother! It was only an allegory, to give
you an idea of my high opinion of her. But, till the
right time comes, our secret will be with me as silent
as the grave.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They talk on, busy with their plans, hopeful of the
future, and what it is to bring, do these two women.
The afternoon flits by, the chirp of the sparrows grows
dull, the sun is sinking aslant the roofs of the opposite
houses, the evening is creeping on apace. Gloria de
Lara rises from her seat, and throws her arms around
Speranza’s neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must go now, mother,” she says gently. “I wish
I could stay, but I have an engagement. Good-night,
my precious mother. Kiss Gloria before she goes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“God bless you, my child,” answers the mother, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>she presses the girl to her heart; “God bless you, and
keep you prospering in your work, my valiant young
Hector D’Estrange.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the girl passes out from her mother’s presence
into the silent square. She is echoing Speranza’s
prayer, and is pulling herself together, for out of that
mother’s presence she has her part to play. She is no
longer Gloria de Lara, but popular, successful Hector
D’Estrange.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>There is yet another scene at which we must
glance before this chapter closes. Let us enter Lord
Westray’s house in Grosvenor Square. He is in the
drawing-room pacing up and down, his face dark with
anger and passion. A footman enters, bearing on a
massive silver salver a tiny scented bijou note. He
hands the missive respectfully to his lordship, who
takes it impatiently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The bearer is to wait for an answer, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Answer be d——d!” begins Lord Westray; but
suddenly recollecting himself, he continues, “Very
well, Walter, come up when I ring.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The servant retires. His face is very grave, but
it relaxes into a leer as he closes the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Spec’s the old un’s rather tired of her by now.
Gives her another week before they sez good-morning
to each other,” he soliloquises to himself as he
goes downstairs. As he does so, Lord Westray opens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the note. It is from Lady Manderton, and runs as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Dearest old Potsie</span>,—Have got a ripping little
supper on to-night. Man’s away, and we will have
some fun. Have asked several kindred spirits. Shall
look for you at ten.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your ever-devoted ‘<span class='sc'>Dodo</span>.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t go,” he mutters. “Hang the woman, I’m
sick of her! She was all very well a little while ago,
but nothing will satisfy me but Speranza now. I
<em>will</em> have her or nobody; and if I don’t have her, I
will have what’s next best, revenge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He writes a note hastily. It is to excuse himself.
He has an awful headache, and cannot come.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Manderton gets the note a quarter of an
hour later, and bites her lip as she reads it. “Never
mind,” she says quietly, “he sha’n’t have another
chance. My next man is Spicer. He’s rich, he’s
good-looking, he’s awfully in love, and he’ll be very
useful. He’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sits down and writes another note. It is
addressed to the Hon. Amias Spicer, Grenadier
Guards. She sends him the same sort of invitation
which she sent to Lord Westray.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not long before an answer comes back. Amias
Spicer is in the seventh heaven. He will be sure to come.</p>

<p class='c008'>And at ten o’clock he comes punctually. Poor
young fool!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Montragee House is decked out at its
brightest. The noble owner, Evelyn, Duke of
Ravensdale, is giving a ball this night, to which all
the pearl of London society has been bidden. Flocks of
royalties have been also invited, and nearly all have
signified their intention of being present. It is a wonderful
sight as one drives up to the entrance gates of
the great mansion, which is ablaze with light. Every
window is neatly framed in soft green moss, from out
of which fairy lamps peep and sparkle like thousands
of glow-worms. Festoons of roses twine around the
porch pillars of the great front door, and the scene
that greets the eye on entry almost baffles description.
Floating throughout the corridors and vestibules
come the soft sounds of dreamy music, the atmosphere
is redolent with the sweet scent of rare and
lovely flowers, the place is a wilderness of beautiful
sights, as up and down the broad flights of the magnificent
staircase well-known men and women come
and go.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>A burst of martial music ever and anon heralds the
approach of royalty. As each successive arrival takes
place, the brilliant crowd sways to and fro to catch a
sight of the gods which it adores. Above, the sound
of lively strains announces that dancing has begun,
and every one hurries to take part in the pleasure of
the light fantastic toe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dance music has suddenly ceased. Every one
has turned to ascertain the cause. The noble host is
observed to be making for the centre of the magnificent
suite of rooms where every one is enjoying his or
herself. He carries in his hand a telegram, and with
the other hand slightly raised, appears to be enjoining
silence. Very striking to look at is Evelyn, Duke of
Ravensdale. His age may be between twenty-five
and twenty-six. He is very tall and broad-shouldered,
his hair, dark as the raven’s wing, close curls about
his forehead, which is high, and white, and intellectual.
His eyes are also very dark, with a soft,
dreamy look in them, his mouth firm set and well
made, is sheltered by a long silken moustache.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silence has sunk on all around. One might hear a
pin drop so intense has it become. Every one is on
a tiptoe of expectation. The sight of that telegram
has set every heart beating.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” calls out the duke, raising
it on high, “I have good news for you all. This is a
telegram from my dear friend, Hector D’Estrange.
He has beaten his opponent by 2,330 votes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>is now member for the Douglasdale division of
Dumfriesshire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>What a shout goes up! Men and women cheer
again and again. It is felt that the pinnacle of fame
on which that young man rests has gone up higher
in the scale of merited success. Even his enemies
cannot help feeling glad, for Hector D’Estrange is
a name to conjure by.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll be Prime Minister before another year or two
are gone,” exclaims Sir Randolph Fisticuffs, just a
little jealously to a lady by his side. She looks at
him earnestly as she replies,</p>

<p class='c008'>“God bless the day when he is! We shall get
justice then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” he answers pettishly, “that’s just it. He
has set all you women discontented with your lot; he
has lit a fire which won’t be readily extinguished.
Mark my words, he’ll burn his fingers over it yet, if
he don’t take care.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not he,” she answers stoutly; “Hector D’Estrange
knows what he is about. He has won the devoted,
undying love of hundreds, nay, thousands and tens of
thousands of women, for his brave, chivalrous exposure
of their wrongs, and defence of their rights.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Randolph Fisticuffs laughs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ought to join the Woman’s Volunteer Corps,”
he observes sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ought I?” She opens her grey eyes wide. “As
it happens, I joined it a year ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“The devil you did!” he exclaims in a surprised
tone. “So you are a Hector D’Estrangeite, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am,” she answers proudly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The music has recommenced; a dreamy waltz is
sounding through the room; every one has begun
dancing again. Only the dowagers are at rest. Not
a man appears unoccupied. Yes, one is, though. It
is the young Duke of Ravensdale himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is leaning against a bank of moss and roses
apparently watching the busy throng. There is a
far-away look in his eyes, however, which tells that
his thoughts have flown beyond the giddy pastime
of the hour. He is thinking of his friend’s latest
triumph, and what will be the outcome of it all. For
Evelyn Ravensdale’s heart has gone out to Hector
D’Estrange, and he loves him with that devoted,
admiring love which some men have been known to
inspire in others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just look at the duke,” whispers Lady Tabbycat
to her friend Mrs. Moreton Savage; “one would think
there wasn’t a pretty girl in the room, or a heart
aching for him, by the way he stands there doing
nothing and saying nothing. I can’t think what
makes him so shy and reserved. He was all fire just
now when he was telling us of Hector D’Estrange’s
triumph; and now just look at him, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Moreton Savage does look at him, but she is
just as far from making him out as her friend Lady
Tabbycat is. Mrs. Moreton Savage is a dame whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>mind has never soared beyond the fitting on of a
dress, the making of matches, and the desirability of
knowing all the best people in society. She has
worked assiduously with those aims in view, and has
the satisfaction of knowing that she has been more or
less successful. Such a thought as the condition of
society, and the people in the past, present, and future,
has never entered her brain. She is quite content that
things should go on exactly as they are, that there
should be immense riches on one side, intense misery
and poverty on the other. Such problems as the
relation of man and woman in this world, and the
terrible evils arising out of the false position of the
sexes, has never troubled her. She has no wish to see
mankind perfected, or to place Society on a higher
level and basis than it is. There is just this difference,
therefore, between herself and the man whom
she and Lady Tabbycat are discussing, and that is
that <em>he does</em>. Often and often have the young duke
and Hector D’Estrange discussed these problems
together in their early morning rides or cosy after-dinner
chats. It is Hector D’Estrange who has converted
him to his present way of thinking. He had
come into his property a sufficiently self-conceited,
spoilt young man; with the world at his feet, men
and women angling for his favours, as many will do
to the highborn and the rich. He had never paused
to wonder what he should do with his money, and
position, and power. He was preparing himself to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>enjoy life in the only way which up till then he had
viewed as possible, when a fateful chance threw him
in the path of Hector D’Estrange.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men wondered at the change in the young Duke of
Ravensdale. It was such a sudden one; they could
not make it out; it mystified them altogether. Some
put it down to love, and wondered who was the lucky
one.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has roused himself from his dreams with a
shake and a start, and is standing upright now. A
boy is passing close by him, a boy with pretty curling
brown hair and large hazel eyes, a boy in whose face
laughter and happiness are shining brightly, a boy
whose life so far has been sunshine perpetual, without
the storm and the hurricane. It would hardly be
possible to find two brothers more extremely unlike
than Evelyn, Duke of Ravensdale, and his younger
and only brother, Lord Bernard Fontenoy. No one
looking at the two standing together would take them
to be related, certainly not so closely as they are.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bernie,” calls the duke, as the boy passes along,
and in an instant this latter is at his side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Evie,” he asks inquiringly, looking up into
his brother’s face. “Anything you want me to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dear,” answers the duke. “I want you to
take my place for an hour or two. I have business
that calls me away. Now, do you think, Bernie, that
I can trust your giddy head to see to everything in
my absence?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Giddy head!” pouts the boy, pretending to look
seriously offended. “If you did well-nigh eight
months’ hard study out of twelve, you would like to
enjoy yourself in the few hours snatched from toil
and mental struggle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor boy! you look hard-worked and suffering,”
laughs the duke, as he eyes the bright, healthy, handsome
face of the youthful complainant; “but seriously,
Bernie, can I trust you to overlook everything for
me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course you can, Evie,” replies Bernard, with a
look of importance. “I promise you I will see to
everything tiptop. I suppose if you’re away I shall
have to take in the Princess to supper, sha’n’t I? Do
you think Her Royal Highness will put up with a
jackanapes like me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think so, Bernie. Anyhow, you must do your
best. Go and make my excuses to the Prince. A
sudden business calls me away; I will be back as
quickly as possible. Meanwhile, my boy, do your best
to take my place. I am sure I can trust you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He lays his hand gently on the boy’s shoulder as
he turns to go. Bernie Fontenoy idolises his brother,
but he feels at this moment as if there is nothing in
the wide world he would not do for him, if it were in
his power.</p>

<p class='c008'>Evie Ravensdale passes quickly down the beautiful
grand staircase towards the front door. Pompous
servants are hurrying to and fro. A big portly butler,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>with a magnificent white waistcoat and ponderously
heavy gold chain, is giving his orders in a voice the
importance of which can only be measured by the
value he puts upon himself. As he sees the duke
descending, however, he moderates his tone, and is all
obsequiousness in a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Repton, give me my cloak and hat, please,” commands
the duke in a quiet, civil voice, and the magnificent
functionary hastens to obey. He is wondering
all the time, however, what it can be that takes his
Grace out at such a time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A hansom, Repton, please.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Repton turns to a crimson-plushed, knee-breeched,
white-silk-stockinged subordinate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Call a hansom, John,” he says loftily. It would
be quite impossible for himself, the great Mr. Repton,
to perform such a menial office; no one could expect
it of <em>him</em>. The whistle rings through Whitehall.
Rumbling wheels answer the summons. In a few
minutes a hansom dashes up. The great Mr. Repton
holds open the front door; Evie Ravensdale passes
out. One of the crimson-plushed, knee-breeched
menials unfolds the cab doors, and stands with his
hands over the wheels while his master springs in;
then he closes them to.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where to, your Grace?” he inquires respectfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Evie Ravensdale, looking up at his brilliantly
lighted luxurious mansion above him, answers somewhat
absently, “Whitechapel.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The fit is on him to see and contrast the misery of
some of London’s quarters with the wealth and the
luxury which he has just quitted. Hector D’Estrange’s
telegram has brought it to his mind. He remembers
his last conversation with that dearly beloved friend,
and how it had turned on that very point. The
splendour of his own mansion, the brilliancy that he
saw around him a few minutes since is about to be
changed for cold, dark, ill-lighted streets, narrow
alleys, and filthy courts. He wants to see it all for
himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hansom rattles through the streets. It goes at
a good pace, but it seems a long time getting to its
destination. At length it pulls up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What part of Whitechapel, sir?” inquires the
cabman, looking through the aperture in the roof of
his vehicle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may put me down here, cabby,” answers the
young duke, handing him half-a-sovereign; “and if
you like to wait for me, I may be about an hour gone.
I’ll pay you well, if you will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a genelman, I can sees that pretty plainly,”
answers the cabman glibly, as he touches his hat, and
pockets the half-sovereign. “I’ll wait, sir; no fear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Evelyn Ravensdale wanders through the gloomy,
ill-lighted streets. Midnight has chimed out from
Big Ben; it is getting on towards one o’clock, and
he does not meet many people. A policeman or two
saunter along their beats, and turn their lights upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>him as he passes. Sometimes a man and woman flit
past him, or a solitary man by himself. He passes
a dark, gloomy-looking archway into which the light
from a flickering gas-lamp just penetrates. He can
see a boy and girl with white, pinched faces asleep in
an old barrel in one corner, a shivering, skinny dog
curled up at their feet. The sight is terrible to him.
He steps into the archway, and touches the boy on
the shoulder. With a frightened cry the lad starts
up and eyes him beseechingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, bobby! Don’t turn us out to-night,” he says
pleadingly. “Maggie’s so poorly and sick, she can
hardly stand up. See, she’s asleep now. Don’t wake
her, please, bobby, don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He starts suddenly, and pulls his forelock as he
perceives that it is not a policeman he is talking
to. “Beg pardon, sir,” he says, “thought it was a
bobby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you no better place than this to sleep in,
my poor lad?” inquires the duke pityingly, his hand
still on the boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, sir! this is a gran’ place. We don’t allays
gets the likes o’ this. Poor Maggie, she was so
pleased when we found this ’ere barrel. See, sir, how
she do sleep.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Maggie your sister?” asks the young duke,
with a half-sob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir, she’s my gal. Maggie and me, we’ves
been together a long time now, we has.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“And what do you do for a living, boy?” continues
Evelyn Ravensdale gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anything, sir, we can get to do. It’s not allays
we can get a job, and then we have to go hungry
like.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My God!” bursts from the young man’s lips, but
he says no more. The next moment he has pressed
a couple of sovereigns into the poor lad’s hand, and is
gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wanders on through the same street. He takes
no note of the name of it. His thoughts are far too
busy for that. He is approaching another street, less
lonely and better lighted than the one he is in. There
are more people about, and he sees several women
loitering up and down near the corner. Instinctively
he crosses the street so as to avoid them. Two of them
are making off after two men that have just passed by,
the third is left alone. She spies the young duke at
once, and runs across the street to cut him off. He
sees he cannot avoid her, and pulls himself together.
In another moment she is by his side, with one hand
on his arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you come home with me, dear?” she says
softly. “Won’t you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Peace, woman!” he almost shouts, as he flings off
her hand from his arm. She starts back with a low
cry, and he sees a face, young still, with traces of great
beauty, but careworn and haggard with suffering.
His heart is filled with a great pity; he feels that such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>sights as these are unendurable to him. He feels that
he cannot face them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor thing, poor thing,” he says gently; “forgive
me if I was rough to you. This is no place for you,
my child. You look a mere child; are you not one?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am eighteen,” she stammers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eighteen, and so fallen!” he exclaims in a horrified
tone. “Ah, child! get away out of this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And starve?” she ejaculates bitterly. “Easy for
you to talk; you are not starving.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Starving!” He utters that word with a peculiar
intonation. It tells her what pity there is in his heart
for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, sir!” she exclaims, “I would not be here if
I were not driven to it. I don’t want to be here. I
hate it; I hate it! It is my hard, hard fate, that I
am here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you no father, no mother to care for you?”
he asks sadly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir, not to care for me,” she answers, with a
sob. “Father’s in gaol. Mother walks the streets
like me, to make her bread. She told me I’d better
do so too, unless I wanted to starve. That’s how it
is, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He covers his face with one hand, and groans aloud.
His thoughts have rushed back to the luxury he has
but lately quitted; he compares it with the misery he
has just witnessed. Once more his hand is in his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“If I give you this, my child,” he says, drawing
out a five-pound note, “will you promise me to go
home at once, and leave these streets of infamy and
wrong; and if I give you my card, and promise to place
you in a way of earning an honest livelihood, will you
call at my house to-morrow for a letter which I will
leave to be given to you? Will you try and get your
mother, too, to come with you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She bursts into tears. “Ah, sir! may God in
heaven bless you. Yes, yes, I will promise; indeed I
will. Gladly, too gladly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He holds out to her the card and the bank-note. As
she takes them she bends over his hand and kisses it
passionately. He draws it gently away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Remember your promise,” he says quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” she answers, between her sobs. “Oh
God! I would die for you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He watches her as she turns away and disappears
in the gloom. Heavy tears are in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must go home now,” he whispers to himself.
“<em>I cannot see more.</em>”</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Ten to one bar one, ten to one bar one, ten to one
bar one.” The ring is roaring itself hoarse over
these words; the hubbub is deafening; it reverberates
all around; it echoes and re-echoes through the hot
June air.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is Derby Day. The waving downs of Epsom
are alive with people; they swarm over every cranny
and nook of the wide-stretching space on either side
of the straight run-in; they surge to and fro like a sea
of dark, moving matter; they contribute to the busy
air of life, that has established its reign on all around.
It is a great day. Always crowded, Epsom is more
than usually so. Old <i><span lang="fr">habitués</span></i> of the place declare, that
never in their memories—and some of them have pretty
old ones—can they recollect such a swarming throng.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the reason for all this crowd is an excellent one.
Have not the people come to see the great horse win?</p>

<p class='c008'>He is in the paddock now, and is being stripped, for
the saddling bell has rung. He is the centre of a
pushing, hustling throng, all eager to catch a glimpse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>of the unbeaten hero of the day; for have not his
triumphs been such as a horse and its owner might
well be proud of, carrying, as he does, the laurels of
the Dewhurst Plate, the Middle Park Plate, and
the Two Thousand Guineas upon him?</p>

<p class='c008'>What a grand-looking horse he is! How his rich,
ruddy chestnut coat glistens in the sun like armour
of burnished gold! Such a quiet beast, too, neither
snatching, nor stamping, nor doing aught that a
restive or vicious racehorse would.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He can’t be beat!” exclaims a young man who has
been standing silently watching the stripping process.
“I’ll be a man or a mouse, Florrie; I’ll stand every
penny I’ve got on him or lose all, hanged if I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be a fool, Reggie,” answers the lady addressed.
She is close beside him, and has laid her hand on his
arm. It is Flora Desmond.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fool or no fool,” he answers quickly, “I mean to
have this dash. I tell you he can’t be beat. It’s
only a question of pluck laying the odds. Hanged if I
won’t stand every penny of the £100,000 which I have
got on him. They are taking twenty to one now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suppose he is beaten,” she says quietly?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I shall be a beggar,” he answers, with a laugh;
“but I’m not afraid. By God! I’ll stand my chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turns as he speaks, and tries to get through the
crowd. What can she do? She has little or no
influence with him, and if she had, this is no place in
which to reason and argue with him. She feels downcast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and sad; for although she, like every one else,
has little doubt in her mind that Corrie Glen will win,
there is just the chance, ever so slight, that he might
not. And if he does not, “well, what then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ruin!” she soliloquises half aloud, as she puts
the question to herself, and answers it in that one
word. There is a bitter smile on Flora Desmond’s
face, for she knows what ruin would mean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you looking Corrie Glen over, Lady Flora?”
inquires a voice at her elbow. She has no need to
turn round to discover the speaker, for she knows the
voice full well. It is that of Hector D’Estrange.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has heard the conversation between Sir Reginald
Desmond and his wife, and as the former elbows his
way through the crowd, he has pushed forward and
sidled into his place by her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Mr. D’Estrange, I am,” she answers just a
shade wearily. “Like every one else, I am looking at
the crack. I suppose he can’t be beat? By-the-bye,”
she adds hastily, “you’ve a horse in this race, haven’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have a mare,” he replies significantly; “and whom
do you think is going to ride her, qualified for a jockey’s
license, and everything on purpose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who?” she inquires absently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Bernie Fontenoy. The boy’s a splendid
rider, and mark my words, Lady Flora, if he doesn’t
win, it will be a near thing between my Black Queen
and Corrie Glen.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>She starts. She has never known Hector D’Estrange
to err yet, and her husband’s rash act recurs more
forcibly to her mind. “May I see Black Queen?”
she inquires hastily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly,” he answers; “come with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They push through the crowd, still surging round
the chestnut horse, and make their way across the
paddock to a quiet spot, where very few people are
observable. A coal-black mare has just been stripped,
and her jockey is standing close beside her. His
colours are tinselled-gold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is Black Queen,” observes Hector D’Estrange
quietly. “You are a good judge of a horse, Lady
Flora; what do you think of her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She does not reply, but walks up to within a few
paces of the mare, and looks her over keenly. She
sees before her an animal which, to her eyes, used
though she is to good-looking horses, is a perfect
picture. The mare is coal-black; there is not a white
hair on her; she is faultlessly shaped all over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think that I never saw a greater beauty in all
my life!” exclaims Flora Desmond, and there is a
true ring of admiration in her tone. As she speaks
the Duke of Ravensdale comes up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you’re going to win the Derby, Bernie, are
you?” he inquires jokingly, as he raises his hat to
Flora Desmond, and holds out his hand to her. “Nice
youngster that,” he continues, addressing her. “Gave
me no peace till I gave him leave to ride, which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>never should have done, had it not been at Hector’s
request; and now I do believe that he thinks he is
going to win!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall have a good try, Evie,” the boy replies in
a mettled voice. “I can’t do more than ride my very
best, can I, Mr. D’Estrange?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No indeed, my boy, that you cannot,” answers this
latter kindly. “Do your best; no one can ask for
more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a light in Bernie’s eye, a flush on his cheek.
Flora notes them both. Full well she knows what
they mean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. D’Estrange,” she says hurriedly, moving a
few paces aside, “may I speak to you for one
moment?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He follows her with a grave, inquiring look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know you never bet,” she continues quickly,
“but do you know what they are laying against Black
Queen?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A hundred to one,” he answers carelessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then will you do me a great favour?” she says in
a sad, pleading voice. “Though you never bet, and I
hate it, will you lay me out a £1,000 in the ring, so
that if Black Queen wins I shall win £100,000? I
wouldn’t ask this of you, only you seem so confident
in your mare, and, and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand,” he answers quietly; “I’ll do it for
you, Lady Flora. The race lies between Corrie Glen
and my mare, and I quite understand why you want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to back the latter. I couldn’t help hearing what Sir
Reginald said over there. It’s on his account, is it
not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is,” she answers bitterly. “As you heard him,
you will quite understand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Leave it to me,” he continues in a kind voice.
“I’ll just give Bernie his last instructions, and then
I’ll hurry across and do your commission. Will you
come over to the stand with Ravensdale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” she answers, with a grateful look in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now Bernie has got his last orders, and the
beautiful mare, with its handsome jockey, is moving
slowly across the paddock to the course. The tinselled-gold
on the boy’s jacket gleams and sparkles in
the sun, and many an admiring eye rests on the two
as they pass out.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has come out last, and is at the tail end of the
long file of horses parading past the stand. Every
one is so keen on singling out the favourite, that
Black Queen at first is not much noticed. Yet the
sparkling gold on the jacket is bound to attract the
eye, and the fact that Lord Bernard Fontenoy, brother
of the Duke of Ravensdale, is riding the coal-black
mare, awakens interest in the dark steed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s little Lord Bernie riding, I do declare!”
giggles Mrs. de Lacy Trevor to Lord Charles Dartrey,
who is leaning over her chair pointing out the horses
and jockeys on the card in her lap. “What a duck
he looks! Oh, I wish Dodo was here!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Can’t think what D’Estrange means by putting
the boy up. He can’t win; and it will only break his
heart,” ejaculates Lord Charles superciliously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How old is Lord Bernie?” queries Mrs. Trevor
in an interested voice. “Oh, I do wish the darling
would win!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s impossible,” says Lord Charles loftily,
“nothing can beat Corrie Glen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They are cantering down to the post now, the
favourite with great raking strides covering his ground
comfortably, and playing kindly with his snaffle, as
his jockey leans forward and eases him a bit. Bernie
has not started the Black Queen yet; he is leaning
down talking to his brother. All eyes are upon him,
however, as they see him squeeze the duke’s hand,
which is laid on the boy’s knee. Suddenly, however,
he dresses himself upright.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must go now, Evie dear,” he says, and there is
a tremor in his voice. “Oh, pray that I may win!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he sets the mare into a canter, and follows in
the wake of the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My word! that mare moves well,” exclaimed Sir
Horsey de Freyne nervously; “don’t half like the
look of her. Think I must have something on her for
luck. Belongs to that deuced lucky fellow D’Estrange,
too. Shouldn’t be surprised to see the gold jacket
flashing in first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bosh!” answers Sir Reginald Desmond, who is
standing next to him. “My dear old fellow, it’s only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>throwing your money away. Corrie Glen can’t be
beat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Sir Horsey de Freyne is not convinced, and
goes off to see what he can get laid him against the
mare.</p>

<p class='c008'>“S’pose you’ve backed the favourite, old chap?”
inquires another shining light at Sir Reggie’s elbow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answers this latter shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Had a plunge, eh?” persists the golden youth,
who doesn’t know a horse from a cow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have got £100,000 on him,” is Sir Reggie’s curt
reply. He is looking through his glasses, and his
face is rather white.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! I say,” blurts out the youth, as he edges off
to tell all those who will listen to him; “I say,
you know, Desmond’s laid out £100,000 on the
favourite.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a murmur in the stands; it runs through
them all like an electric shock. “They’re off!” is the
hoarse cry that resounds suddenly from hundreds of
throats. To an excellent start, Lord Marcovitch
Bolster has despatched the lot, and as they all stare
through their glasses, they can perceive that Hamptonian
has taken up the running, closely followed by
Masterman Ready, Holyoakes, and Kesteven. Lying
fifth is the favourite, and two lengths behind him
gleams a flashing spot of gold. A strange horse is
overhauling the lot, Hamptonian drops back, and the
stranger creeping to the front makes the pace terrific.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>But fast as he goes he cannot shake off the chestnut,
who apparently without effort is going easily enough,
and keeping his place as fifth in the crowd. Now the
spot of gold seems nearer up; it passes Corrie Glen,
and falls into fourth place, Kesteven retiring to the
rear. They are racing down the incline. Masterman
Ready begins to tire, and the spot of flashing gold
closes up to Holyoakes. These two come along neck
and neck, Corrie Glen just behind them, the strange
horse still in the van. Tattenham Corner is reached.
They round it in the order named, and enter the
straight; but here the stranger is in difficulties, and
Holyoakes and Black Queen, on which sits the spot
of gold rigid almost as marble, begin to close upon
him. A little more than a quarter of a mile from
home they reach him, and he flings up the sponge,
retiring to the rear. There are only three horses left
in the race now, Holyoakes, Black Queen, and Corrie
Glen. This latter is drawing up to the first two
named, with great raking strides he is alongside them,
and quickly the three are abreast. A distant roar
sounds in Bernie’s ears, there is a film over his eyes,
his heart feels as if it must stop beating, but he sits
very still, and does not attempt to urge his horse any
faster. Suddenly he sees a flash on his left. The
jockey who is riding Holyoakes has his whip out, and
Bernie knows he has nothing any longer to fear from
him. He glances to the right; the great chestnut is
flashing along; there is no whip needed there.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Oh God! let me win,” bursts from the boy’s pale
lips, as he tightens his rein ever so little, and touches
the mare gently with the spur. He is surprised at
the effect. He thought she had been going fast before,
but she is going faster now. She is quite a length
ahead of Corrie Glen, and the jockey of this latter is
visibly surprised. He has begun to ride the horse at
last, and his whip is actually out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Corrie Glen wins! Corrie Glen wins!” comes the
wild shout from the stands, as the noble chestnut, with
a supreme effort, closes with the Black Queen. They
are hardly fifty yards from the winning post; the roar
is terrific. Bernie hears it, but he can see nothing
now. He makes, however, a final effort, and calls on
the mare once more; he has never used his whip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Corrie Glen wins! Corrie Glen wins!” The
words pierce to his brain. He has done his best, he
cannot do more; he knows this well; yet would to
God he could win!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Corrie Glen wins!” Ah! they don’t know the
Black Queen. She has answered the boy’s last call;
she has made one more magnificent effort; and, shooting
ahead of the favourite, passes the post a winner by
a neck!</p>

<p class='c008'>What a yell goes up from the ring! Blank deadly
consternation is in the faces of the backers. In the
stands there is very little cheering. Hardly a soul in
all that vast crowd has backed the “dark” black
mare.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>And Sir Reginald Desmond is still standing where
we left him. He is deadly pale; his arms are folded
on his chest; there is despair in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Had a bad race, old chap? I fear we all have,”
says a voice at his elbow. He laughs, and turns
towards the speaker. This latter starts as he notices
the ghastly, haggard look on the young baronet’s
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes—well, yes, haven’t had a good one,” answers
Sir Reggie coolly, taking out his cigarette-case and
leisurely selecting a cigarette therefrom. “Have a
cigarette, Fernley?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No thanks, Desmond, am just going to have
lunch. Wonderful race young Bernie Fontenoy rode
there. Won’t the brat be proud?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! ah! yes, won’t he?” answers Sir Reggie
absently. His thoughts have wandered again. He
is looking ahead into the black future. Now that it
is too late, he is cursing himself for a fool and an
idiot. Oh! why did he not take Flora’s advice?</p>

<p class='c008'>The stand in which he is, is nearly empty. Every
one is making off to get lunch; in a few minutes it is
entirely deserted. He sits on alone in it. The cigarette
he had lit so ostentatiously not long since has gone
out, but it is still clenched between his teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The future <em>will</em> rise to his mind. How can such as
he face it? He has never been brought up to do anything;
he is ill-read, ill-taught, and ignorant. He has
never given his mind to anything but amusing himself;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and now if he pays the ring what is justly owing to
it he will be a beggar, with nothing to live on and
nothing to look forward to but misery, and, in his
eyes, disgrace.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Sir Reginald! He feels his position acutely,
it is burning itself into his brain. He feels that it is
past endurance, that <em>he cannot</em> face it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll go home,” he says wearily to himself. “I
can’t face Flora after this; it’s all too dreadful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He rises wearily and goes out. The back of the
stand is more or less crowded by the hangers-on and
scum of every race-course. How he hates and loathes
the sight of them now; how their rough, coarse,
pleasure-seeking faces bring up to his mind, with
haunting horror, the great loss which he has sustained!
He is staying near the race-course, and has
not far to go, so he hurries through the crowd and
makes straight for The Laurels, which is the name
of the place. He reaches it, and tries the front door.
It is locked; of course no one is expected back yet.
He knows of a side-entrance though through the
smoking-room. Ten to one the careful servants have
forgotten it. He walks round and tries it. Yes, true
enough, they have. Very quietly Sir Reginald slips
in. In another moment he is upstairs and in his
bedroom.</p>

<p class='c008'>He turns the key in the door, and goes over to the
writing table. His face is still deadly pale, and he
walks like one who has had too much to drink. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>sits at the table and scrawls a few hurried lines. They
are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Flora dear, forgive me. I’ve been a brute and
an idiot. Would to God I had taken your advice!
But it’s too late now. You’ll pay the ring for me,
dear. Let them know it was my last wish. If I lived
we should be beggars, and I can’t condemn you and
the ‘little one’ to that. But at my death you’ll get
all that money that is to come to you and the child.
Good-bye, dear old girl. You’ve been good and kind to
me. This is about all Reggie can do to show you he is
grateful. Good-bye. Forgive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She has been looking for him a long time, and so
has Hector D’Estrange, but there is no sign of Sir
Reginald Desmond anywhere. At last she can stand
it no longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must go back to The Laurels,” she says;
“perhaps he is there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Estcourt, who is standing by her, offers to accompany
her, and thither they proceed in silence. Of
course when they reach the house no one has seen
him. The servants assure her ladyship that Sir
Reginald has not returned; they must have seen him
if he had. They forget to add that the greater
number of them have been perched on the high wall
surrounding The Laurels, during the greater part of
the day, watching the races.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“I’ll just run up to the bedroom and have a look,”
says Flora to Estcourt. “I won’t be a minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waits below, but almost directly hears his name
called,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Estcourt, come here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He races up the stairs. He finds her standing outside
the door of a bedroom.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t get in,” she says hurriedly. “I’ve called,
but there is no reply. Oh, Estcourt! do you think he
is in there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He makes no reply, but runs downstairs. In a few
minutes he is back with a hatchet. Curious servants
are following him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stand back,” he says to Flora. She obeys, and
the young man brings the hatchet with tremendous
force against the lock. Three, four, five strokes, and
he has broken it to shivers. Then he opens the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Reginald Desmond is seated at his writing table.
His left hand is beneath his chest, his head is resting
on the table above it, his right is outstretched and
hanging over the side. Just below it on the floor lies a
revolver, and drip, drip, drip, dripping on to the chair
on which he sits, is a stream of running blood. Who
shall judge him as he lays there silent, and fast
stiffening? for—</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is dead, and blame and praise fall on his ear
alike, now hushed in death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Those may do so who can. I cannot.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Were you in the Commons last night? Did
you go to hear Hector D’Estrange?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rather; I think all the world was there, or trying
to be there. I don’t think I have ever seen such a
crowd before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a wonderful speaker he is, to be sure!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. With the exception of Gladstone, I don’t
suppose there ever was one like him, or ever will be
again. Talk of orators of bygone days! Pooh! they
never came up to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, the women have got the Suffrage in full at
last, thanks to him. The next thing is to see what
use they’ll make of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better, perhaps, than we men have.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The speakers are two men, the Honourable Tredegar
Molyneux, M.P., and Colonel des Vœux of the Blues.
Nearly four years have passed since the events related
in the last chapter. The world has been slowly
marching forward, and many things have happened
between that time and this. In the political world,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and in Parliament, like everywhere else, Hector
D’Estrange has made a stir. His eloquence and
debating power are the wonder of all who hear him,
and his practical, sympathetic knowledge of the social
questions of the day has made him the idol of the
masses. He has just succeeded in carrying his
Woman’s Suffrage Bill by a large majority, thereby
conferring on women, married or unmarried, in this
respect, identical rights with men. And now to-day
in the monster Hall of Liberty, which he has founded,
and which has been erected by the lavish subscriptions
of the women of Great Britain, Ireland, and the
world at large, he is to preside at the ceremony of its
opening. It <em>is</em> a monster building. Talk of Olympia,
of the Albert Hall—why, they are dwarfs beside it!</p>

<p class='c008'>In shape it is circular, and towers aloft towards
heaven, its great dome pinnacle crowned by a cap of
glass, which report declares to consist of a million
panes. Around this glass a gilded crown is twined,
and holding it there—one in a kneeling attitude, the
other upright, with one hand high upraised towards
heaven—are two gilded women’s forms. They are the
Statues of Liberty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The interior of this vast structure is wonderful to
look upon. The floor or centre is raised, and constructed
so as to move on a pivot slowly round. It
consists of an immense ring, the middle of which
presents the appearance of a giant circus. On the right,
or side facing the great entrance, is a monster swimming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>bath, and exactly opposite, or on the other side
of the circus, is a huge platform. Suspended in mid
air, a very network of trapezes and other gymnastic
appliances hang, while stretched tightly beneath them
is a monster net. Around the arena, with a low palisade
separating it from the same, is a broad circular
horse-ride, and raised slightly above this, running all
round in a similar manner, a roomy promenade. Then
come tier above tier, tier above tier of seats, amidst
which here and there boxes are placed promiscuously,
while dotted about all over these countless and seemingly
never-ending stories, are cosy platforms enthroned
in a wealth of green, where abundance of refreshments
are obtainable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The seats come to an end at last, and are replaced
by six broad balconies running entirely round the
building, and built one above the other; opening on to
these balconies are what appear to the spectator in
the arena as thousands of pigeon-holes. In reality
they are doors, communicating each one with a tiny
but compact room, in which stands a bed, two chairs,
a washhand-stand, a small dressing table, and a
writing table. It is stated that in all, opening off
from these balconies, are ten thousand rooms. These
rooms have been included in the building to accommodate
women students from all parts of the world,
who may wish to take part in the physical drill or
educational advantages afforded by this great central
institute for the training of womankind. Attached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>to the Hall of Liberty are large lecture-rooms, studying-rooms,
and reading-rooms, and in connection with
these a monster library. Outside the building are the
stables, one of the wonders of London, the grooms
being entirely composed of girls and women; and
clustering round the mother structure like a miniature
town, are the pretty cottages and dwellings of the
immense staff of instructors, teachers, and lecturers
connected with the institution. It is a wonderful
structure, and its erection is a triumph, the magnitude
of which can hardly be measured, for Hector
D’Estrange. It was he who conceived it, it was he
who submitted it to the approval of his countrymen,
and it was he who commanded the expenditure of
the voluminous subscriptions, which in answer to his
appeal poured in from all quarters of the globe. No
less marvellous was the rapidity with which it arose,
thousands of workmen having been employed in its
construction.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is finished now; it towers to heaven like a mighty
giant from some unknown world. The gilded Statues
of Liberty flash back the sun’s rays, and stand out
to view for miles and miles around. All London is
flocking to the ceremony of its opening, for is not the
genius that conceived and placed it there to be the
principal functionary of the day?</p>

<p class='c008'>All is orderly in the streets; the vast crowd is held
and kept in check by the military and the police. A
good-humoured, happy crowd, it seems to be, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>here and there occasionally a little rough horse-play.
But no harm is done. The people are on their best
behaviour, for Hector D’Estrange, the idol of that
people, has appealed to them to preserve order.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vast building is rapidly filling. Since the
great doors have been thrown open, it has been one
successive influx of people. There is no disorder, for
there is a separate passage for the holders of each
class of ticket, and along these the incomers are
marshalled by the liveried servants of the establishment.
It is a wonderful sight to see the people
swarming to their places, and all the while through
the building trembles dreamy music, which thrills
the senses, and makes them all aglow with gentle and
tender feeling. At last it is full. There is not an
inch of standing room in all that vast space set aside
for spectators; every seat is appropriated. Not a
vacant one to be seen, and it is computed that there
are 50,000.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every class is there; from the prince and peer, to
the labouring man and peasant, all have come,
attracted by the all-powerful genius who is to address
that monster meeting this day. Imbued with the
same feeling, impelled by the same curiosity, attracted
by the same sentiment, that crowd of mixed denominations
and sexes awaits his coming in breathless
expectation.</p>

<p class='c008'>And it has not long to wait. The clock is striking
eleven, when a distant roar is heard, and the strains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>of martial music come floating from afar. In the
great Hall of Liberty a sudden hush has fallen; the
dreamy music has ceased abruptly, and a supreme
silence reigns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again that roar! It is like the booming of a
thousand cannons. It is steady now and unceasing;
it rushes forward along the dense walls of spectators
that throng the streets on either side of the way up
which Hector D’Estrange has to pass.</p>

<p class='c008'>A whisper runs through the vast hall, a whisper
of suppressed excitement and expectation. “He is
coming; he is coming!” is on every one’s lips, as with
eyes aglow and hearts thrilling with eagerness, the
people bend forward in their seats to watch for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowds outside the building have begun to
cheer. The martial music is very distinct now. The
plaudits are every moment becoming more intense,
until they break into a deep and prolonged roar. As
they do so, the great folding doors of the Hall of
Liberty are thrown open, and the people rise in a body
to their feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is entering now. Preceded by the band of the
White Regiment of the Women’s Volunteer Companies,
playing a march triumphant, he passes through
the giant portals. His head is bared, and he is
mounted on a milk-white horse, which he sits with
grace and ease. As he does so the sun shines down
on his dark auburn hair, lighting it up with the tints
of old-gold that play amidst the curls which nestle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>on his high, white brow, while the sapphire light in
his glorious eyes shoots forth with a gleam of triumph
as he surveys the magnificent scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is dressed in the White Guard Regiment uniform
of the Women’s Volunteer Companies, of which
he is Commander-in-Chief; but the regiment itself
is his own especial one. It was the first which he
established four and a half years ago, when he first
took the matter in hand. The idea has prospered
since then, and the women enrolled in all the companies
of the Volunteer force number 200,000.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a fitting uniform for the occasion, one which
he has done well to don; for the first business of
to-day’s ceremonial will be the march past of the
“picked” of the companies of these 200,000.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has ridden round the broad, spacious horse-ride
followed by one or two especial friends, conspicuous
amongst whom is the Duke of Ravensdale. The
cheering is deafening; it never ceases for a moment.
It swells and swells again, like the mighty midocean
waves, that bear onwards in their wild career
to break on the lone sea-shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now he has dismounted, and, with his friends,
has taken his place on the evergreen flower-decked
platform. Even as he does so his dark sapphire
eyes are raised aloft, and sweep with their dreamy
gaze the thousands that throng that vast Hall of
Liberty, as if seeking amidst the multitude one
especial form. It is even so; and as they roam the sea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>of faces, all turned to his, they are suddenly brought
to a standstill. The anxious, searching look within
them dies away, giving place to one of calm contentment
and repose, for Speranza is there.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mother’s eyes are fixed upon her child. Through
the filmy distance of space cannot Gloria perceive this
well? For a moment, one brief moment, the hero of
the hour is Gloriana de Lara, in the next, he is Hector
D’Estrange. The audience is still cheering,—it seems
as though it will never cease,—but he has raised his
hand, and like magic a great silence falls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he begins, and the clear,
exquisite voice thrills through the huge building, “I
shall have a few words to say to you before I declare
the Hall of Liberty open, but first we will witness the
march past of the representatives of all the companies
of the Women’s Volunteer force of which I have the
honour to be Commander-in-Chief.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A flourish of trumpets and loud cheering greets this
announcement. Once more the great entrance doors
unfold, the band of the White Regiment strikes up a
march, as through the portals, ten abreast, and mounted
on grey horses, that regiment advances at a trot.</p>

<p class='c008'>And at their head is one whom we have seen before.
Very handsome she looks in her uniform of pure
white cloth, with the gold facings glittering on her
breast, and her sword in its silver sheath dangling
sparkling at her side. Flora Desmond is not greatly
changed since we saw her last, in appearance certainly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>but over her life has come a wondrous transformation.
She is Hector D’Estrange’s right hand, and in aiding
him to carry out his noble aims is thoroughly in her
element.</p>

<p class='c008'>The white troopers advance at a trot rapid enough,
but as each line passes the platform on which Hector
D’Estrange is standing they break into a canter, increased
to a gallop, whirling round the broad-spaced
horse-ride in magnificent order. Looking along the
serried line of horses’ heads hardly a hair’s breadth in
difference can be distinguished, so compact is the
position which is maintained throughout the ranks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The march strains cease, and give way to a flourish
of trumpets. Simultaneously the galloping steeds are
reined on to their haunches, remaining motionless as
statues. Thus they stand until the voice of Flora
Desmond is heard giving the order to retreat, when
they fall into position, and retire at the trot, she riding
round to join her chief on the platform.</p>

<p class='c008'>And in this wise, headed by their respective bands
and officers, representative companies of Hector
D’Estrange’s two hundred regiments march or gallop
past him. The ceremony occupies some two hours,
but they roll by all too quickly for the spectators, who,
spell-bound by what they see, watch the revolving
scenes with the keenest interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last one closes appropriately. Crashing and
rumbling through the wide-opened entrance dash the
artillery. They come on at a rapid pace, and wheeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>round into the vast arena form up into splendid line.
The work of detaching the horses and unlimbering the
guns is that of a moment. In the next, a tremendous
roar rings forth from the mouths of a score of cannon
which have been rapidly charged and fired.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ere the echoes have died away the horses are again
attached, the guns as rapidly limbered up, and one by
one the gun-carriages dash from the scene, the great
doors closing upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then cheer after cheer rings through the densely
packed building as Hector D’Estrange advances to the
front of the platform to speak. But he is raising his
hand once more, as though appealing to be heard, and
again a great silence falls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are here to-day,” the bright, clear ringing
voice declares, “to open a building the magnitude
of which cannot be measured by any other in the
world. The Hall of Liberty stands here to day as a
living witness to the desire of woman to be heard. It
was six years ago that I first saw it in my dreams.
It is reality now, and will endure through all time, as
a memorial of the first great effort made by woman to
shake off the chains of slavery, that ever since our
knowledge of man began, have held her a prisoner in
the gilded gaols of inactivity and helplessness. I stand
here to-day prepared to deny that woman is the
inferior of man, either in mental capacity or physical
strength, provided always that she be given equal
advantages with him. I go further still, and declare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>that in the former respect she is his superior. You
deny it? Then give her the chance, and I have no
fear but that she will prove that I have not lied. You
have to-day seen passed in review 10,000 representatives
of the 200,000 volunteers that in a little more
than four years have been enrolled and drilled into
the splendid efficiency witnessed on this memorable
occasion. Will you pretend or seek to tell yourselves
that in warfare they would be unavailing? I laugh
such an idea to scorn. One of our most heart-stirring
writers—I allude to Whyte-Melville—has left it declared
in his writings, ‘that if a legion of Amazons
could be rendered amenable to discipline they would
conquer the world.’ He was right. The physical
courage, of which men vaunt so much, is as nothing
when compared with that greater and more magnificent
virtue, ‘moral courage,’ which women have shown
that they possess in so eminent a degree over men;
and hence physical courage would come as an agreeable
and welcome visitor where hitherto it has been
forcibly denied admission.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Men and women who hear me to-day, I beseech you
ponder the truth of what I have told you in your
hearts. You boast of a civilisation unparalleled in
the world’s history. Yet is it so? Side by side with
wealth, appalling in its magnitude, stalks poverty,
misery, and wrong, more appalling still. I aver that
this poverty, misery, and wrong is, in a great measure,
due to the false and unnatural position awarded to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>woman; nor will justice, reparation, and perfection be
attained until she takes her place <em>in all things</em> as the
equal of man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, my friends, I will detain you no longer.
In this great Hall of Liberty woman will find much
which has long been denied her. It is but a drop
in the ocean of that which is her right, yet is it a
noble beginning of that which must inevitably come.
I declare this Hall of Liberty to be open.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That is all. He says no more, but with a stately
inclination to the vast audience turns back to where
his friends stand. His horse is led forward by a
youthful orderly in the uniform of the White Regiment,
and as he mounts it the band strikes up once
more. Bareheaded as he entered, he rides slowly
from the scene of his triumph, and passing again
through the portals of the Hall of Liberty comes out
into the densely, wall-lined street, amidst the roar of
the thousands that are there to greet. Such is the
welcome of <em>the people</em> to Hector D’Estrange.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Lord Westray sits alone in his sanctum in
Grosvenor Square. There is an anxious expression
on his face, for he has been expecting some one
who has not turned up. He has already consulted his
watch about half-a-dozen times, and he consults it
again. Then he gets up and rings the bell.</p>

<p class='c008'>He can hear it tinkling downstairs from where he
sits. “A smart servant,” he thinks to himself, “would
have answered it quickly.” Yet he would think this
no longer, if he could only hear “his smart servant’s”
remark anent that bell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“James,” calls out that worthy, who is seated in
the room on an easy armchair in front of the fireplace,
with his feet against the chimney-piece, “what
bell’s that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My lord’s, sir,” is the laconic reply from the
lackey outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! ah! tha-a-anks. Let him ring again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bell does peal again, this time furiously, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Stuggins, with a face of disgust, pulls his feet down
from the chimney-piece.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My word! what a hard time of it we have’s,” he
ejaculates to himself, as he rises slowly from his seat
to go upstairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>On reaching Lord Westray’s sanctum, however, his
face is composed and affable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the second time I’ve rung,” exclaims Lord
Westray angrily. “Surely, Stuggins, there is some one
in the house to answer the bell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was in my room, my lord, and did not hear it,”
responds Stuggins in a conciliatory voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has no one called yet, Stuggins?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he’ll be here at any moment now. Mind he
is shown up without any delay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the sleek, over-fed domestic goes off smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ten minutes later, and there is a ring at the doorbell.
Lord Westray starts and listens.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s he!” he ejaculates briefly.</p>

<p class='c008'>And in a few minutes the “he” is politely waved
in by Stuggins.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Trackem, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, Stuggins, shut the door. Not at home
if any one else calls.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very good, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The door is shut, and Lord Westray rises and shakes
the new-comer by the hand.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Glad to see you, Mr. Trackem,” he observes
heartily. “Began to fear you were not coming. A
little late, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little, my lord, but I was usefully employed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Made out where she is, Mr. Trackem?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” responds this latter solemnly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lord Westray rubs his hands delightedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where?” he asks eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Near Windsor, my lord. I found it out by
shadowing Mr. D’Estrange.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Capital!” exclaims Lord Westray, with a laugh.
“And does she still go under the name of Mrs. de
Lara?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Mr. Trackem, what are your plans?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Trackem puts on a mysterious look, walks
quickly to the door of the sanctum, and opens it
suddenly. “What do you want?” he inquires
sharply of some one without.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you please, sir, I was just coming in to see if his
lordship had rung,” answers Stuggins stolidly, who
had never quitted the outside of the door since we
last saw him, and who had been listening intently all
the time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord Westray did <em>not</em> ring,” answers Mr. Trackem,
coldly, “and you are <em>not</em> required.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! very good, sir,” and Stuggins retires defeated,
and much put about.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Trackem watches the butler’s retreating form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>till it is out of sight, then he closes the door softly,
and returns to his original place near Lord Westray.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These are my plans, my lord. I propose to take
down two of my men by rail. Two will be ample, as
more might attract attention and be in the way. I
shall send a brougham and smart pair of trotters
the day before. I have ascertained by observation
that Mrs. de Lara invariably goes for a walk in the
evening by herself, that her servants do not sit up for
her, as she writes in her study late at night, and I
have further ascertained that she is frequently in the
habit of leaving the house before any one is up, and
coming up to town. This is a most valuable point, as
her absence will attract no attention. But to be safe
I have possessed myself of some of her writing paper
and a sample of her writing, and a note will be duly
left, apprising her maid of her departure, and intention
to remain in London for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By Jove, Mr. Trackem, you are a smart one! I
don’t see how your plan can fail,” exclaims the wicked
earl with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never fail, my lord, in any of these little businesses,”
answers Mr. Trackem, with a suave smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But ain’t you afraid of the police finding you out?”
inquires Lord Westray, just a little nervously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Trackem laughs outright. “Police!” he
ejaculates contemptuously. “What’s the good of
them? Think they know a lot, know nothing. Why,
my lord, the police are useless in matters of this sort;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>and as for detectives, why, it’s easy to green them up
the wrong way. I don’t fear them. I’m a match for
every noodle detective in and around Scotland Yard,
I am,” and Mr. Trackem gives a self-satisfied laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Mr. Trackem, when is it to be?” inquires
the earl anxiously, after a short lull in the conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s to be the day after to-morrow,” answers Mr.
Trackem. “To-morrow my men go down. I shall
follow, and just give them a squint at the place, and
then they’ll be all prepared for the next day. Never
fear, my lord; by Wednesday she shall be in your
power.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In <em>my</em> power!” The words come triumphantly,
though mutteringly, through the ground teeth of the
man whom Speranza de Lara had called, and justly
so, “a fiend in human shape.” Yes, she had spurned
him, loathed him, defied him, forbidden him her
presence. Through these long years he had striven
to regain her in vain, and now—ah, now!—he would
be amply and surely revenged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I am sure, Mr. Trackem, I cannot thank
you sufficiently for the excellent way in which you
have laid your plans in order to carry out my commission,”
he says warmly. “And now to business.
I am to give you £50 down now, and the remaining
£150 when the transaction is finally accomplished.
Is not that so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is, my lord,” answers the vile creature blandly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Lord Westray pulls out a drawer in his writing
table, and taking out a cheque book is not long in
writing off an order for £50 to the credit of self.
This he hands to his visitor, who accepts it deferentially,
and commits it to a greasy pocket-book, after
which he takes up his hat and stick, preparatory to
leaving.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you take something?” inquires the earl
with his hand on the bell. “A glass of sherry,
brandy-and-soda, or what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No thank you, my lord, nothing,” answers Mr.
Trackem. “Must keep a clear head in my business.
Thanks all the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They shake hands, these two scheming monsters,
both intent on a base and ruffianly deed, yet one of
them is regarded as a gentleman, is received and
welcomed by society, is high in the graces of the
Government of the day, and accounted a clever man
and useful statesman. Clothed in these mantles of
virtue, he is free to do as he pleases. Wickedness will
not bar Society’s doors against him, or lose him his
high preferments. Is he not a man, one of the dominant
and self-styled superior race? Therefore, is he
not free to do as he pleases?</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>The day has come,—a hot July one. Down upon
the dusty country roads the sun has burnt fiercely all
day long. The cattle and beasts of the field have
eagerly sought for shade and refuge from the torturing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>flies that ever haunt their presence, but evening
has fallen at last, and with it relief has come.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is cool and pleasant along the banks of the old
Thames. The silver streak glides sluggishly along,
with the moon’s pale light playing softly upon it.
The stars twinkle merrily forth to endure their brief
sweet reign; Nature looks ghostlike in her mantle of
sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fairy cottage, half hidden in walnut trees and
clinging ivy, peeps forth upon that scene. The smooth
lawns around it gleam white as the driven snow
beneath the moon’s soft gleams. Tall dark trees rise
up behind in ebony framework, making an efficient
background, while through the still air trembles and
quivers the nightingale’s exquisite song.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would seem, at a first glance, as if all were asleep
in that cottage; but no, there is yet a light left in one
of the rooms on the ground-floor. Suddenly a pair of
window-doors in it are flung open, and a tall, graceful
woman steps out through them. Her head is uncovered,
the moon gleams down upon the thick masses
of pale gold hair that cover it, and shines in her
glittering eyes of turquoise-blue. It is Speranza de
Lara.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a glorious night!” she soliloquises to
herself. “I suppose my darling is speaking now.
She said it would be about ten o’clock. Oh, Harry!
my precious long-lost love, would that you could see
<em>our</em> child now!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>She has pressed the ring with its glittering
brilliants to her lips,—the only ring she wears. The
stones flash and sparkle in the moon’s light like gems
of living fire, beautiful, pure, and shining as the love
that is next her heart. Much more than a score of
years have passed away since Harry Kintore died in
her arms, but if she lived through countless scores
of years that love would burn just the same. She
wanders along the gravel carriage drive, her thoughts
busy with the past. Anon they fleet forward to the
future, and then a light of triumph dances in her
eyes. But it is with the past that she is chiefly occupied
this night, for it is the 14th of July, the anniversary
of the day on which her darling died.</p>

<p class='c008'>She has passed along the shady avenue, and entered
a tiny straggling path, shut in by tall dark trees. It
is a glade upon which the gardener has not been
allowed to bestow his fostering care. He has been
forbidden this spot by his mistress, who loves to leave
it in possession of the primrose and violet, the wild
anemone or dark blue hyacinth that Nature has
scattered so plentifully around. It is Speranza’s safe
retreat, away from the outside world, the spot where
she best loves to roam.</p>

<p class='c008'>All is quiet; not a sound disturbs the tenor of her
thoughts as she walks quietly along. Suddenly, however,
her eye is arrested by a gleam of light in front
of her. The next moment two dark forms spring
forward in her path, and she sees that they are men.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Speranza is no coward. We already know that
well. Screaming is without her ken, she has no
knowledge of it. Of fear, she only knows the name.
If it is a thrill that permeates the body from head to
foot, and sends the blood rushing through the system
with irresistible impetus, then Speranza knows what
that strange, mysterious sensation called fear is.
But then it only makes her feel defiant. She has no
thought of fleeing. Her impulse is to stand and face
the danger, whatever it may be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you?” she asks in a quiet, measured
voice; “and what do you want here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You,” is the laconic answer, as the speaker seizes
her by the arm, and deftly getting behind her, endeavours
to draw her two elbows together. The pain is
excruciating, but Speranza’s blood is up. She is no
weakly woman, helpless with life-long inactivity and
want of muscle power. She is strong and flexible as
wire, and makes her assailant feel this too, as with
a wrench she frees herself, and springs backward
behind him, facing them both once more. With a
foul oath the man who had first attacked her bares
a short, ugly-looking knife, and his companion does
so as well.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No use resisting!” exclaims this latter. “If you
do you’ll get a taste of these. Better come quietly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She does not even answer them. Her lovely head
is thrown back, her blue eyes shoot defiance, even
while in them trembles the look of despair. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>hands hang clenched by her side, but she never quails
for a second.</p>

<p class='c008'>They rush at her, their knives poised threateningly.
She seizes the blades with both her hands, and holds
them with the grim clutch of a last great effort.
With a brutal laugh they jerk them backwards, and
the sharp, keen edges cut clean into her tightly closed
palms. Out pours the rich, dark blood from the cruel,
gaping wounds, as with a low cry, the first that has
escaped her, she lets go her hold. Then, with the
ferocity of tigers, they spring upon, and force her to
the ground. In another moment the gag is on her
mouth, tight straps are round her arms and ankles,
and she is a prisoner at their feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on quick, now!” exclaims one of the men.
“My, Bill! she be a strong, plucky one, and no
mistake! If it ’adn’t been for that there root we
shouldn’t have mastered her so easily—no, nor we
should.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The root referred to is the jagged, stumpy end of
a fallen tree. Against this Speranza’s head had struck
in falling, rendering her senseless. No wonder they
tied her so easily.</p>

<p class='c008'>They lift her between them, and carry her across
the copsewood towards a low hedge, outside which
lies the road. Over this they hoist her, and then lay
her down on the pathway, one of them giving a long,
low whistle.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is an answering whistle down the road, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>rumbling and stamping as of carriage wheels and
horses’ feet. Two lights gleam through the darkness,
like the eyes of some terrible monster, and the next
moment a carriage dashes up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got her?” inquires a thin, spare man, jumping
out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right as a trivet, sir,” they answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, put her in! Look sharp; no time to lose.
I thought I heard footsteps as I came along,” and
Mr. Trackem, for it is he, holds open the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>They obey his orders without more ado, and then
he jumps in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now then! look alive, men! One on the box, one
in with her and me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is done. The men are “sharp uns.” They
know their master, and he knows his men. The
next moment the carriage is bowling along towards
Windsor, <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> for London.</p>

<p class='c008'>Who will track them, who discover them? Not the
detectives of Scotland Yard!</p>

<img src='images/i_105.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>
<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>There has been a late sitting in the House of
Commons. A protracted debate on the crowded
condition of the filthy alleys and slums in that most
wonderful city of the world, London, has kept members
fully occupied. But twelve o’clock, midnight, has
struck, and the Commons are dispersing. It has been
a great night for Hector D’Estrange. He has spoken
for an hour and a half to a spell-bound audience;
for does it not know full well that the subject of that
night’s discussion is one in which he is no novice, it
having been undertaken on his own motion?</p>

<p class='c008'>He has spoken for an hour and a half, and has told
them many things. Has he not a right to do so?
None like him have dived into those terrible slums,
have visited night after night, as he has done, those
abodes of crime, of vice, of wickedness, and of misery.
He knows them well, and has depicted them as they
<em>are</em>, to the wondering representatives of a nation, in
language of which he alone is master.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>He has seen much, and knows much of the horrors
which he has depicted so vividly, yet not even he
knows some of the depths of infamy that exist in
that cesspool of Modern Babylon. He has yet another
experience to incur.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear old Hector, that was a grand speech of
yours!” exclaims the Duke of Ravensdale, who, having
been an attentive listener during the debate, has run
down to join his friend as the latter leaves the
Commons. “Come across to Montragee House, and
let us have a little supper. Wish you would stay
there the night, old man!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t, Evie,” replies Hector. “I have to go
down to Windsor by an early train, and must go home
and order my things to be packed up; but I’ll come
across for half an hour or so and have a mouthful, as
I went without my dinner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They walk along, linked arm-in-arm, towards Whitehall,
and as they do so Big Ben chimes out the hour
of half-past twelve.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How time flies, to be sure!” remarks the young
duke thoughtfully. “Funny thing time is—eh,
Hector?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is,” answers this latter gravely; “a something
without being, shape, or substance, and yet a thing
that has been, is, and yet shall be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a happy chap you ought to be, Hector! I
don’t suppose there’s an hour in your life which you
can look back upon as having wasted or misspent, save
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in doing good and trying to help others,” exclaims
his friend in an almost envious tone. “Would to God
I could say the same of myself!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, Evie! don’t try and make me vain; and
don’t run yourself down before me. I won’t allow it.
God knows you are earnest enough in your desire to
do good, and, dear Evie, you have succeeded. I don’t
suppose there’s another in your position who has done
so much. I never had such a good true friend as you
in all my undertakings, except one, and of course I
except her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Her!” exclaims his friend in a somewhat surprised
voice. “Whom, Hector?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My mother,” he answers quietly. “She has been
my right hand through life. I could not have got on
without her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your mother, Hector!” says the duke in a low
voice. “Have you a mother alive?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Evie, and one of the best that ever lived. I
will introduce her to you some day. She knows you
well by hearsay, for I have often spoken of you to her.
But a favour, dear old Evie; don’t ever mention her
to any one; promise me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not, Hector. You know the simplest
wish of yours is law to me. Well, here we are; we’ll
finish our chat inside over some soup and oysters, and
anything else you like to have.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The duke’s hand is on the bell, but he pulls it very
softly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Won’t do to peal it,” he remarks. “The sound
would awaken Bernie, he’s such a light sleeper; and
always will get up to welcome me if he awakes, dear
little chap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s see, how old is he now?” queries Hector
D’Estrange; “well nigh sixteen, is he not? He’s a
dear lad, and I like him especially on account of his
love for you. He does love you, Evie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answers the duke softly, “and I love him.
Bernie is all I have got to love, unless it be you,
Hector.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He does not see the bright flush that rises to Hector
D’Estrange’s beautiful face, or the passionate look in
the sapphire eyes. It might have startled him if he
had. But the great massive doors are unclosing now,
and he enters, followed by his friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Supper in my study, Repton, please,” he exclaims.
“Is Lord Bernard asleep?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fast, your Grace,” answers that individual confidentially.
“His lordship wanted to sit up for your
Grace, but when I gave him your Grace’s message he
went straight to bed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” says the duke heartily. “Bernie’s
a good lad. God bless him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two have moved on into the duke’s study, and
Repton has hurried off to command his Grace’s supper
to be served immediately. He has pompous manners,
has Repton, a high opinion of himself, and certain
notions of his own importance and dignity, but he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>a good servant nevertheless, and a faithful one. He
is not of the Stuggins’ class. He would as soon dream
of keeping his Grace waiting for his supper as of
jumping over the moon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The consequence is, that in the twinkling of an eye
supper is served in the study. And the two friends,
as they sit discussing it, wander off on some favourite
theme, so that the time passes quicker than they
think. Suddenly they are startled by hearing a bell
peal. The duke springs to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good heavens! What can that be?” he exclaims
nervously. “Is it Bernie’s bell; is the boy ill, I
wonder? I must go and see. It’s past two o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the front door bell, I think,” says Hector
D’Estrange. “Hark, Evie! there are voices in the
entrance hall. Open the door and listen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The duke does so. A woman’s voice is plainly
distinguishable, appealing to Repton.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For God’s sake,” he hears her saying, “let me
see the duke. I must see him. It is a matter of life
and death. If you tell him it is for Mr. D’Estrange
he will see me, I know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have no orders from his Grace to admit you,”
answers Repton pompously, “and certainly cannot
disturb his Grace at this hour. You must write or
call again to-morrow morning, and all I can do is
to report your wish to his Grace.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He bangs the door to as he speaks, but the next
moment steps sound behind him, and Hector D’Estrange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>has seized the handle and pulled it open. His face
is very white, and there is terror in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rita!” he calls out, “is that you, Rita? My
God! what brings you here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. D’Estrange!” she bursts out with a low, glad
cry. “Oh, are you here? Thank God! thank God!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She has rushed forward and seized him by the
hand, and the duke, who has followed close behind
him, recognises in the youthful, fair-featured girl the
sad, haggard, careworn, starving creature whom but
a few years back he had rescued from prostitution and
degradation. Yet in what a terrible condition she
seems. Her dress is torn and mudstained, her shoes
likewise, her fair, soft hair dishevelled and hanging
about her face and down her back, while her expression
is that of one scared by a terrible fear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come quick, come quick!” she cries imploringly,
“before it is too late. Oh, Mr. D’Estrange! they
have waylaid her, and carried her off. I saw her
bound, with her poor cut bleeding hands, and could
not help her; but I know where she is, and can guide
you to the place, if you will only come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rita,” exclaims Hector D’Estrange, in a voice
the very calmness of which fills her with awe, “come
into the duke’s study for a minute, and explain yourself.
Follow me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He leads the way with Evie Ravensdale following,
and she close behind the duke. As for Repton, he
is rigid with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>The three enter the study, and the door is closed.
“Now, Rita,” queries Hector excitedly, “explain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” she cries again. “It is your mother.
She was out in her favourite walk this evening about
ten, and I was coming home rather late from Windsor.
I saw her attacked by two men in the spinny, bound
hand and foot, after having been knocked senseless. A
carriage drove up, and they put her into it. My first
impulse was to rush to help her and shout for assistance,
but in a moment I reflected how useless that would
be. I determined to hang on to the carriage behind,
and see where they took her to. It was a terrible
drive, but God helped me, and I succeeded, though I’m
about done. I saw the house they took her into. I
know the spot well; I can take you there straight now.
But come, please come, or it will be too late.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a look of fury and hatred so intense in
Hector D’Estrange’s eyes, that the duke can hardly
recognise him as the sweet, gentle-featured friend
whom he loves so dearly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Evie,” he says in a strained, unnatural voice, “I
can explain nothing now. It is impossible. But you
can trust me, Evie. My mother, my precious mother,
is in terrible danger. Will you help me to save her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The duke’s reply is laconic, but Hector knows its
meaning. They are simple words, “I will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then come,” he exclaims feverishly; “lead on,
Rita, brave, plucky Rita! I’ll never forget what you
have done to-day.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>She does not reply, for they are hurrying out of the
room. They are in the hall now, and both Hector and
Evie Ravensdale have seized their hats. But the next
moment the duke has slipped a loaded revolver into
his pocket, and handed another to his friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take this,” is all he says. “You may want it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a four-wheeler at the door. They all three
get in quickly. As Rita does so she gives the order,
“Whitechapel. Quick,” she adds, “and you shall be
paid well!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cab-horse trots swiftly along. The hope of a
substantial fare has given the cabby wings. No well-bred
brougham horse could go quicker. He flies along
does that old cab-horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the outskirts of Whitechapel Rita calls a halt.
“We must get out here,” she observes. “Mr.
D’Estrange, please give the cabman a sovereign, and
tell him to wait.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He obeys her. He can trust her, can Hector
D’Estrange. Ever since the day when, at Evie
Ravensdale’s request, he had appointed her as his own
and his mother’s secretary, Rita Vernon has served
him with a fidelity and painstaking exactitude of
which he knows no parallel. She leads the way
through dark, uninviting streets. She knows the
locality well. She learnt it years ago, before Evie
Ravensdale came there to save her from a doom far
more terrible than death. She had declared then that
she would willingly die for him. The same feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>animates her now. For Evie Ravensdale Rita Vernon
would deem it a happiness to die.</p>

<p class='c008'>They have passed through courts and filthy alleys,
through streets well and ill-lighted. Very few people
are about. Only a policeman or two on their beats pass
them as they move along. Now they are turning into
a sort of crescent or half square, with houses superior
to those of the localities they have traversed. As
they do so Rita turns to the two men following her,
and pointing to a house at the further end, exclaims,
“There!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There are no lights in the windows; the place is
silent and dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How shall we get in?” asks the duke.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a bitter smile on Rita’s face as she replies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will show you, but remember you must play your
part. I shall pretend I am bringing you here, and
that there’s another woman coming. I’ll order a
room, and once in there I know how to find her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She says no more, but passes swiftly along the
pavement, they close at her heels. On reaching the
house she pulls the bell softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The door is opened cautiously, and a woman’s face
peers out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s wanted?” she inquires suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve brought these gentlemen here,” answers Rita.
“We want a room. Your best if it’s empty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t have you to-night,” replies the woman.
“The whole house is took.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>She is about to shut the door when Rita springs
into the opening. The next moment she has the
woman by the throat. “Quick!” she cries in a low
voice. “Gag her, tie her hands and feet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>No need to speak further. Both Hector D’Estrange
and Evie Ravensdale have obeyed. Three handkerchiefs
suffice to gag the woman, tie her ankles
together, and her wrists behind her. Then they look
at Rita.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put her in here!” exclaims this latter, opening
a door on the right. “It’s dark. Never mind; I know
the place; she’s safe there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They lift her in, and lay her on the floor. Rita
closes the door, and locks it. A dim light is burning
in the hall, but no one is stirring; only in the distance
they think they catch a sound of voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on,” she says excitedly. “I am sure I can
find them. They’ll be in the best room. Follow me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She goes up the stairs quietly, her companions as
noiselessly following. On reaching the landing she
turns down a passage to the right, and comes to a
halt opposite a door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen,” she says in a low tone. “<em>You two should
know that voice.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>But she has no time to say more. Pale with fury,
with murder in his eyes, Hector D’Estrange has burst
open the door. A flood of light almost blinds him
as he enters, but through it all he sees the mother
that he loves.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Speranza de Lara is stretched on a sofa. Her
ankles are still tightly secured, her wrists likewise.
Around her, like a cloak of gold, falls her lovely hair.
There is a mad, wild look in her eyes terrible to
behold, but her lips are mute and speechless, for she
is gagged. And beside her stands that monster, that
petted <em>roué</em> of Society, that “fiend in human shape,”—the
Earl of Westray.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a loud cry as a shot rings through the
silent house.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><em>BOOK II.</em></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>It is the year 1900. Men are hoping that it will
be a peaceful one, after the factious bickerings of
1898–99. While the National party and the Progressists
have been snarling over contentious bones,
they have omitted to notice in the bye-elections
unmistakable signs of public weariness and disgust
with squabbles so profitless.</p>

<p class='c008'>The National party, into which the Unionists have
been merged, and the Progressists—a party arisen on
the ashes of the Liberals—have failed to take warning
by these signs. Woman’s Suffrage, established as law
by the action of Hector D’Estrange, has materially
altered the aspect of the old state of things, and
brought about a thorough and healthy change of
thought in many places. The women have given
their aid enthusiastically to Hector D’Estrange, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>worked heartily in support of the youthful reformer.
Almost every bye-election has returned a D’Estrangeite
candidate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now at length the General Election is over, and
the Parliament returned is a curious one. Including
the Irish, Scotch, and Welsh Home Rulers, the
D’Estrangeite members are in a majority, the
Nationals coming next, and the Progressists last.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet the majority referred to is a somewhat
precarious and unworkable one, for if the two latter
parties choose to combine, they can wreck the new
Government completely. No one knows this better
than Hector D’Estrange, who, having been invited by
his sovereign to form a Cabinet, has succeeded in doing
so, and occupies the proud position of Prime Minister
at the age of twenty-eight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only sixteen years since Gloria de Lara made her
vow to the wild sea waves,—and now?</p>

<p class='c008'>Has the prayer that accompanied that vow been
answered?</p>

<p class='c008'>Not yet.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>“Is it not tempting defeat, my child, to introduce
the bill at so early a date?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mother dear, it is my only opportunity. The
position I hold is, I know, quite untenable for any
length of time. The Government may be defeated at
any moment, and then my chance is gone. Though I
have not the slightest hope of carrying the bill, I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>yet gain a tremendous point by its introduction. I
shall be defeated on it without a doubt, but it will
be before the country, and I can appeal to the country
upon it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ever right, my child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The speakers are Speranza and Gloria de Lara.
The former is now fifty years of age, but years sit
lightly on her shoulders. The new century beholds
her as lovely and youthful-looking as ever; time has
not played havoc with that fair face.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the pale golden hair is golden still. No sign
of whitening age is discernible in the thick tresses.
It seems as though fair youth will never quit her side,
for Speranza is unchanged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unchanged in all save one thing. Since that
terrible day, upon which the last chapter closed so
abruptly, there has dwelt in Speranza’s lovely eyes
a hunted, haunting look of fear. She has never quite
recovered from the shock of that most awful trial, and
none dare mention to her the name of Lord Westray.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has never been heard of since that day. His
disappearance at the time caused the greatest excitement.
Men declared that he must have been foully
murdered, and his body secreted by the murderer or
murderers. Of course the blame was thrown on the
Irish, with whom Lord Westray was no favourite. Not
long before his disappearance he had been appointed
Chief Secretary for Ireland, an appointment that had
given the greatest dissatisfaction to the Irish. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>was nothing beyond surmise, however, to account for
his fate.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are sitting in Speranza de Lara’s private room
in Montragee House, which has been her home ever
since the terrible day above referred to. Apartments
in the huge building have been set aside for her use,
for it is the delight of Evie Ravensdale to lavish upon
the mother of his dearest friend on earth all the affection
and love of a son. And his love is returned
indeed, for Speranza’s heart has gone out to him with
all the love of a mother, a love only surpassed by that
which she feels for her child.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great day has come at last, when Hector
D’Estrange is to introduce to Parliament his bill for
the absolute and entire enfranchisement of the women
of his country. The bill, it is whispered, is not a
mere stepping-stone to future power for the sex, but
a free and unfettered charter of liberty, a distinct
emancipation from past slavery, a final and decisive
declaration that women are not man’s inferiors, but
have as clear and inalienable a right as he to share the
government of their country, and to adopt the professions
hitherto arrogated by men solely to themselves.
Hector D’Estrange’s colleagues have been
made aware of the bill’s contents, and have loyally
and nobly elected to stand or fall upon it. They have
all been selected for their singularly wide and sympathetic
views, and are not likely to forsake their
chief in the moment of trial. So also can he depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>upon all the D’Estrangeite members, without a fear
that there will be a single seceder from their ranks;
but he knows that the defeat which he expects will
come from the united forces of the Progressists and
Nationals, who for a time have buried their feuds and
disputes, in the desire to defeat the revolutionary
schemes of Hector D’Estrange.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a knock at the door, and, in response to
Hector’s invitation to enter, it opens, and a young man
comes in. It is Lord Bernard Fontenoy, very much
grown since we saw him last. He is eighteen now,
but looks older, and is the Duke of Ravensdale’s
Secretary, the duke being Minister for Foreign
Affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A telegram, Mr. D’Estrange,” he observes.
“Will there be any answer?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hector takes the missive and opens it. It is from
Flora Desmond, and runs as follows:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“The ten regiments have marched in from Oxford,
and are quartered in the Hall of Liberty. Twenty-seven
miles completed in eight and a half hours; not
a single private fell out of the ranks. Will be down
to see you in an hour or so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Bernie; no answer, thanks. Is Evie in yet?”
queries the recipient.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll go and see,” answers the youth, vanishing as
he speaks.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Dear mother, I must leave you now, but will see
you again before I go to the House. Estcourt and
Douglasdale will be here directly, and the latter is
to escort you to-night,” observes Hector D’Estrange,
rising and kissing Speranza.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mother throws her arms around her child. The
anxious look in her eyes is intensified.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My darling, may all go well with you to-night.
It is foolish, I know, but there is a foreboding of
evil next my heart which I cannot shake off, try as I
may. Ah, Gloria! if aught should happen to you,
my precious child, what would your mother do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, mother, what ails you, dearest? Evil happen
to Gloria? What fancy is this? Of course I expect
defeat; but that will not be evil; merely the beginning
of a great end.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not allude to that, dear one, but to something
quite different. Gloria, I had a terrible dream last
night. I saw him close to me, the being that I loathe.
He had you down, and stood above you with a naked
sword raised threateningly. I rushed to save you, but
ere I could avert his arm he had pointed it straight
down at you, and pierced you to the heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tush, mother, a mere dream, that’s all. You
must not dwell upon it. Dear mother, put it from
your mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would to God that I could, Gloria! But it haunts
me like a spectre, and will not pass away. However,
my child, I must not damp your spirits with my fancies.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Go now to your duties, from which I must not keep
you, and mother will do her best to drive the dream
away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right, motherling. Do, for Gloria’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He kisses her tenderly and goes out, for he hears
Evie Ravensdale’s step approaching. The two friends
and colleagues meet just outside the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go to your room, Evie,” he says gently,
“and let us have a chat before I go to work. Chats
with you are a luxury now. We don’t find much time
for them, do we? By-the-bye, I have just had a
telegram from Flora Desmond: the regiments have
reached the Hall of Liberty. She reports the last
march of twenty-seven miles in eight and a half
hours, with not one single fall out from the ranks.
Yet they would have us believe that women are weak,
feeble creatures, unable to endure fatigue. There is
the lie direct.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They pass on into the duke’s study, a room full of
pleasant memories for Hector D’Estrange. Many a
happy hour has he spent here with the truest and
best friend of his life, the one man whom he loves
above all things, and, with the exception of Speranza,
the only being to whom he is passionately attached.
A big oil painting hangs above the fireplace. Two
figures are represented on the canvas. One is a
tall, dark-haired, dark-eyed man, with long silken
moustache and aristocratic mien, the other of shorter
and slighter build, with a face of exquisite beauty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>The features are those of a very young man, the eyes
are sapphire-blue, the glossy, close curling hair of
a deep old-gold colour. It is easy to recognise the
former as Evelyn, Duke of Ravensdale, the latter as
Hector D’Estrange. The picture has been executed
by the duke’s order, and represents the two friends first
meeting—ever memorable for both.</p>

<p class='c008'>They sit on alone together, these kindred spirits,
happy in the communion of each other’s thoughts.
They are seeking to scan the future and what it will
bring, diving into the days that have yet to come.
With Evie Ravensdale, it is a firm belief in the
ultimate success of Hector D’Estrange’s scheme, a
supreme and absolute confidence in his young chief’s
ascendant star.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder who will be the first woman Prime
Minister,” he observes dreamily. He is looking into
the glowing coals, and does not notice the flush that
rises to Hector D’Estrange’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, yes, who indeed?” echoes the latter quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sometimes I think, Hector, that I can see her.
Certainly I have seen her in my dreams,” continues
the young duke softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you describe her, Evie?” asks his friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask me to paint your face, Hector, and then you
have her in living life. Yes, my woman Prime
Minister is an exact counterpart of Hector D’Estrange.
Ah, Hector! if you were only a woman how madly
I should love you; for love you as I do now, it can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>never be the same love as it would be if you were
a woman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is fortunate that the shaded and softly subdued
lamps in Evie Ravensdale’s study are low, or certainly
the look in Hector D’Estrange’s face would have
betrayed the secret of Gloria de Lara. As it is, he
only laughs softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I am your woman’s ideal, am I, Evie?” he
asks in a would-be bantering tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Hector, you are. Your face is too lovely for
a man’s. You ought to have been a woman. And
yet if you had been, the glory of Hector D’Estrange
would be an untold tale. There is, alas! no woman
living, I fear, who would have been able to beat down
the laws that held her enchained as you have done.
How the women worship you, Hector, and rightly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The front door bell is pealing. In a few minutes
the study door is opened, and Lady Flora Desmond
is announced.</p>

<p class='c008'>She comes in easy and graceful, her White Guard’s
uniform fitting to perfection her supple and agile form.
People have grown accustomed to Hector D’Estrange’s
women volunteers. The uniforms no longer strike
them as strange and unfeminine, for custom is the
surest cure with offended Mrs. Grundy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a dense crowd there is, to be sure!” she
exclaims, after first greetings have been exchanged.
“I had hard work to get my guards through it. But
they are in order now, and a clear way is kept right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>up to Westminster, so you will have no difficulty in
getting your carriage along, Mr. D’Estrange.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it so late?” he inquires in a surprised tone.
“Evie and I have been talking away, and did not
notice how the time was slipping. Pray wait here.
I shall not be many minutes dressing. I must wear
my White Guard’s uniform to-night, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, Mr. D’Estrange. I will wait for you
here,” she replies. There is a ring in Flora Desmond’s
voice which tells how happy she is. She has never
dreamed of seeing such a day as this.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>He is standing on the steps of Montragee House,
clad in his White Guard’s uniform. A long line of the
White Regiment keep the road clear to Westminster.
The crowd is dense all round. Nothing but a sea of
faces can be seen, and the cheers of the people have
grown into a hoarse, continuous roar. Thousands and
thousands of women are amongst that crowd, women,
with hearts full of love and devotion for their hero;
women who would account it a happiness to die for
him at any hour; women who are strong in their
gratitude for what he has done, and is trying to do for
them. He has entered the carriage that stands in
waiting in front of the ducal mansion, and with Evie
Ravensdale has taken his seat therein. As it drives
rapidly towards Westminster the mighty volume of
cheering is again and again renewed, a few hisses
being here and there noticeable.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>How describe the scene within the House of Commons?
To attempt to do so would be but to court
failure. The precincts are thronged until there is no
standing room. There is eager expectation on every
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roar of the crowd outside has penetrated the
vast building, and tells those within that he is
approaching. A thrill runs through that assembly of
princes, peers, commoners, and ladies who are there
to await his coming, and then the silence of intense
expectation falls on all around.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is entering now, and walks slowly forward
to take his seat. He is received with a burst of
enthusiasm by his own colleagues and party, and is
watched with interest by every woman who looks
down upon him from the spacious galleries that at
his instance have been erected for ladies, in place
of the wild beast cage originally considered by men
as good enough for the inferior sex. And now he
has taken his seat while awaiting the usual formalities,
and the eyes of the House are upon him. It
would be a trying position for an old Parliamentary
hand, one used to many years of debate. Is it not
just a shade so for Gloria de Lara, as she sits there
under the name of Hector D’Estrange preparing to do
battle for her sex?</p>

<p class='c008'>But she has risen now. The silence of death has
fallen once more on the House, for the clear, beautiful
voice is speaking at last, and this is what it says.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Mr. Speaker, I make no apology to you, sir,
or to honourable gentlemen for the bill which
I am about to introduce to the House. It is a bill
embodying a simple act of justice to woman, a tardy
though complete offer by man to repair the wrong
which he has done her in the past. Now the bill is
simple enough, and contains no ambiguous clauses.
It states in terse, clear language what it is that we
propose to bestow on woman, the rights to which she
is entitled, and the manner in which we suggest that
they should take effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have rightly, though tardily, bestowed the
suffrage upon her. That was an act which should
have been performed years ago, but one which has
been delayed by much of that unwieldy and unworkable
machinery that clogs and hampers the operations
of the Westminster Parliament. I refer to the
numerous local affairs of England, Scotland, Ireland,
and Wales, which, as you know, I have frequently
expressed as my opinion, might be more profitably,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>efficiently, and quickly disposed of in the separate
countries named, leaving the time that is consumed
here in attending to them free for the consideration
of great Imperial and National social questions,
which are, alas! and dangerously so, being pressed
into the background.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The bestowal of the suffrage on woman is a practical
acknowledgment by man that woman has a
right to be considered as a being who can reason, and
who can study humanity in its various phases, and act
on her own responsibility. It is not for me here to
seek for the causes which have hitherto led man to
believe to the contrary. His belief, in a great measure,
has been due to woman’s weak acceptance of his
arbitrary laws; for I do not suppose it will be pretended
by any one that the laws laid down for the
sacrifice of woman’s freedom were the creation of
a woman’s brain. But this weak acceptance of these
arbitrary laws cannot fairly be ascribed entirely to the
fault of woman. ‘Slavery in no form is natural;’ it
is an artificial creation of man’s; and woman’s slavery
cannot be taken as an exception to this maxim. She
has, in point of fact, been subjected to bondage, a
bondage which has, in a manner, become second nature
to her, and which custom has taught her to regard as
a part of the inevitable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if honourable gentlemen will believe me,
Nature is stronger than custom, and more powerful
than law. Nature is a force that cannot be repressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>finally and absolutely. It is like an overwhelming
torrent against which you may erect monster dykes,
which you may dam up for a time, but all the while
the waters are rising, and will find their level in the
end. Through countless years woman has been
repressed. Every human force and ingenuity of man
have been employed to establish her subjection.
From religion downwards it has been the cry ‘Women,
submit to men!’ a cry which I may safely say was
never originated by herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now Nature has established a law which is inviolable.
It has laid down the distinction between the
sexes, but here Nature stops. Nature gives strength
and beauty to man, and Nature gives strength and
beauty to woman. In this latter instance man flies in
the face of Nature, and declares that she must be artificially
restrained. Woman must not be allowed to
grow up strong like man, because if she did, the fact
would establish her equality with him, and this cannot
be tolerated. So the boy and man are allowed freedom
of body, and are trained up to become muscular
and strong, while the woman, by artificial, not natural
laws, is bidden to remain inactive and passive, and in
consequence weak and undeveloped. Mentally it is
the same. Nature has unmistakably given to woman
a greater amount of brain power. This is at once
perceivable in childhood. For instance, on the stage,
girls are always employed in preference to boys, for
they are considered brighter and sharper in intellect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and brain power. Yet man deliberately sets himself
to stunt that early evidence of mental capacity, by
laying down the law that woman’s education shall be
on a lower level than that of man’s; that natural
truths, which all women should early learn, should be
hidden from her; and that while men may be taught
everything, women must only acquire a narrow and
imperfect knowledge both of life and of Nature’s
laws.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I maintain to honourable gentlemen that this procedure
is arbitrary and cruel, and false to Nature. I
characterise it by the strong word of Infamous. It
has been the means of sending to their graves unknown,
unknelled, and unnamed, thousands of women whose
high intellects have been wasted, and whose powers for
good have been paralysed and undeveloped. To the
subjection and degradation of woman I ascribe the
sufferings and crimes of humanity, nor will Society
be ever truly raised, or ennobled, or perfected until
woman’s freedom has been granted, and she takes
her rightful place as the equal of man. Viewing this
great social problem in this light, we have deemed it
our duty to present to Parliament a bill, establishing
as law, firstly, the mixed education of the sexes, that
is to say, bringing into force the principle of mixed
schools and colleges, in which girls and boys, young
men and young women, can be educated together;
secondly, the extension of the rights of primogeniture
to the female sex, so that while primogeniture remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>associated with the law of entail, the eldest born, not
the eldest son, shall succeed the owner of property
and titles; also that all the professions and positions
in life, official or otherwise, shall be thrown open as
equally to women as to men; and thirdly, that women
shall become eligible as Members of Parliament, and
peeresses in their own right eligible to sit in the
Upper House as well as to undertake State duties.
Such is the drastic, the sweeping measure by which we
desire to wipe off for ever and repair, though tardily,
a great wrong. Honourable gentlemen will perceive
that we take no half-way course. We are not inclined
to accept the doctrine of ‘by degrees,’ believing that
this would only prolong the evil and injustice which
daily arise from the delay in emancipating the female
sex; and I will now as briefly as possible set forth
to honourable gentlemen the arguments in favour of
the three clauses contained in this bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“With regard to the first one, namely, the advisability
of educating girls and boys, young women and young
men, together, it is necessary to point out that the
system of separating the sexes throughout their educational
career has arisen chiefly from the totally
different forms of education meted out to each. We
hold that these different forms are pernicious and
morally unhealthy, calculated to evilly influence the
sensual instincts of the male sex, and to instil into the
other sex a totally wrong and mischievous idea of the
right and wrong side of Nature. We are convinced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>that this system has been productive of an immense
amount of immorality and consequent suffering and
degradation in the past, and that the system of elevating
Nature into a mystery is the greatest conceivable
incitement to sensuality and immorality. We hold
that there should be no mystery or secrecy anent the
laws of God. We hold that in creating mystery we
condemn God’s law—namely, Nature, to be what it is
not—indecent; and we hold that the system of separating
the sexes, of telling all to the one and enshrouding
everything in silence and mystery to the other, has
had the evil effect of producing immorality, so wide
and far-spreading as to be frightful in its hideousness
and magnitude; while it has been productive of
millions of miserable marriages, of disease, and of evil
immeasurable and appalling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nature tells us truths which we cannot condemn as
falsehoods, however much we may avert our eyes from
their light. Nature tells us that it is natural for the
male and female sex to be together. If we bring up
the young to face this truth, if we bring up the young
to accept as natural and rational the laws of pure and
unaffected Nature, they will accept it as it is. But if
we clothe it in boys’ and men’s eyes in fanciful garments,
and leave girls and women in ignorance of its truths,
we must expect the terrible and horrible results which
have followed such unnatural teaching through centuries
of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We therefore emphatically in this clause record our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>protest against the system of teaching the young to
regard Nature in a false light, in other words, to judge
of God’s laws as impure. We believe such a system
of education to be, as we have said, an incentive to
the male sex to do wrong, while totally unfitting the
female sex to do right. The beginning of all immorality
on woman’s side has sprung from ignorance, and
from the system of mystery and the tendency to declare
indecent that which cannot be so, being God’s law.
In regard to the physical condition of the sexes, we
hold that where equal opportunities are afforded to
both of strengthening, developing, and improving the
body, little material difference will be found in the
two. There are many strong men in this world, and
there are many strong women, as there are weakly
men and weakly women. I have never heard it yet
argued, that because a man is not strong in body he
is therefore unfitted to take part in the affairs of State.
Yet woman’s weakness is one of the reasons adduced
for excluding her therefrom. We believe that in a
big public school, say, for instance, at Eton, if girls
and boys were admitted together, that girls would
very soon prove that neither physically nor mentally
were they inferior to boys, nor should such a pernicious
doctrine be ever inculcated into the boy’s brain.
He should not be brought up as he is now, to look
down on his sisters as inferior to him, nor should
those sisters be told that he is their superior in
strength and mental capacity. It is a doctrine the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>perniciousness of which is far-reaching, and a distinct
infringement of the natural.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This leads us to the consideration of the second
clause, the adoption by women of those professions
hitherto arrogated to themselves solely by men. We
are of opinion that, granted a similar education as men,
women are in every way as fitted to occupy those
professions. I may be allowed here perhaps, to refer
with pride to that magnificent body of women over
200,000 strong who are now enrolled in the regiments
of the Women’s Volunteer forces, of which I am proud
to call myself a member, and whose uniform I am
fittingly wearing on this occasion. We have before
us a splendid evidence of woman’s power to combine
and come under discipline. These regiments are kept
up to their full force, and are all due to individual
effort and womanly sacrifice. There is no State aid in
the question, and yet the efficiency of each regiment
is perfect. Disbanded and scattered, they can be
summoned to their ranks at a few days’ notice, without
fear that they will fail. I point to this as a brilliant
example of what women can accomplish in so short
a time, by self-sacrifice and simple determination.
The same argument of their efficiency to enter the
army applies to the navy, and to any other profession
hitherto occupied solely by man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, believing as I do, that with the admission of
women into the conduct of affairs of State, wars, and
all their attendant horrors, would quickly become a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>thing of the past, I dwell shortly on the second clause,
passing on to the third, which, in conjunction with
the first, I regard as the most important part to be
examined.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is now eleven years since County Councils were
established. At the very first elections women were
chosen as representatives, but on an appeal to the
law they were ousted from their seats. We have
wisely remedied that state of things, and no one thinks
it odd or extraordinary now, to see women sitting
in these County Councils as members. On the contrary,
it is tacitly acknowledged that their presence is,
and has been, productive of much good. Well, will
honourable gentlemen tell me in what great particulars
these County Councils differ from Parliament?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Both are debating assemblies, and both are conducted
on almost similar lines. What is there preposterous
and appalling in the suggestion that women
should become Members of Parliament, and when,
by genius or talents, they can attain to such, assume
Cabinet rank, and claim the right to carry on the affairs
of their country? It is merely custom that now debars
them, a custom established by the selfishness and
arrogance of man, and accepted by woman in the same
manner as slaves in the past, from long custom, accepted
the lash from their taskmasters. The taskmasters
had established the right to flog their slaves; they
had dammed up the slowly rising waters of rebellion,
but these rose to their level at last, and overflowed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and slavery is no more. The analogy holds good in
the case of woman, whose greater slavery is not yet
entirely overcome. That it will finally be, is as certain
as that the hours of Time never go back. You
may fight against it, you may pile the dykes higher,
you may go on damming the rising waters as you will,
but the time must inevitably come, when those dykes
and dams will crumble away beneath the overwhelming
flood, which your own efforts will have entirely accumulated
and brought to its tremendous and irresistible
strength. We may be met with many arguments in
condemnation of this bill. One will be that it will
obstruct the rite of marriage. We deny this. We
grant you that it may diminish the number of
marriages, but we contend that this will be a blessing
rather than a curse. Thousands of miserable unions
are yearly effected in consequence of woman’s unnatural
and one-sided position in Society. In all these
cases she does not marry because, with a knowledge
of the subject, with every profession thrown open to
her and chance to get on equal to men, she is satisfied
that she prefers married life. No. In the cases referred
to, she marries for money, or for position, or
to escape the restraints of home, or because she has
no chance of making her way in the world, and the
result is that these marriages are miserable failures,
and the offspring of such either diseased in body or
in mind, or condemned to grow up to a life of misery,
and, in thousands of cases, immorality and crime.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“There is a problem creeping gradually forward upon
us, a problem that will have to be solved in time,
and that is the steady increase of population. If it
advances at its present rate, the hour will come when
this earth will not be able to contain it. What then?
We may possibly by that time have arranged, with
the aid of science, for conveyances which shall carry
our superfluous population to other realms of light,
but it is equally possible that if this be so, those
realms may not consent to receive the emigrants.
What then? I believe that with the emancipation
of women we shall solve this problem now. Fewer
children will be born, and those that are born will
be of a higher and better physique than the present
order of men. The ghastly abortions, which in many
parts pass muster nowadays, owing to the unnatural
physical conditions of Society, as men, women, and
children, will make room for a nobler and higher order
of beings, who will come to look upon the production
of mankind in a diseased or degraded state, as a
wickedness and unpardonable crime, against which all
men and women should fight and strive. The emancipation
of women will, I am convinced, lead up to the
creation of the great and the beautiful, to higher
morals and nobler aims.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yet, as we are now, what is the sad reality? In
this huge, over-crowded city alone, the greatest the
world has ever known, amidst rich and poor alike,
teems immorality awful and appalling in its magnitude.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Deeds are committed of which even some of the most
vicious have no idea. Thousands are born in our
midst who should never see the light of day. Born
in disease, these miserable victims of vice and immorality
grow up to beget to others like horrors, and in
the teeming millions of this vast city alone exist
misery and sin too terrible to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We submit, therefore, to honourable gentlemen that
the first step towards the regeneration and upraising
of mankind is the emancipation of woman, and with
her emancipation the careful training of the sexes
together. Convinced that the time has come, when
it would be dangerous to delay this emancipation, we
have made it the plank on which the Government of
the day intend to stand or fall. We would further,
perhaps, overstep the bounds of custom, and ask that
the fate of the measure be decided to-night by a vote
taken on it immediately. If the vote be adverse, the
Government will at once resign, and appeal to the
country on the clauses of the bill. They are clauses
which I think, to-night, it would be but waste of time
to discuss. They can be discussed before the country
if the bill be rejected. Yet, ere I sit down, I would
beg of honourable gentlemen to consider the few
words which I have had the honour, and, I thank God,
the opportunity to make to them. I would appeal to
them to put aside party feeling, and vote for the
common good as their consciences dictate. I solemnly
warn them, however, that they cannot put back the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>hand of time, and that the hour must be reached at
last when the cause of woman will triumph; for, as
I have already remarked, Nature is like the rising
waters of a great flood, which the hand and ingenuity
of man may restrain for a time, but which must find
a level at last and overflow. The course of Nature
is unconquerable; no art of man can defeat it, wrought
as it is by the hand of God.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He has sat down. He has been heard throughout
in death-like silence, but now the Ministerialists and
D’Estrangeites are cheering him again and again.
Yet chill as ice are the Nationals and Progressists.
They cannot rise to the height of generosity to which
he has appealed. In this moment of uncertainty for
many, Hector D’Estrange knows that the bill is
doomed.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>The House has divided. It has recorded its vote.
The numbers for and against the emancipation of
women have been announced. The author of the bill
was no false prophet when he predicted defeat. By
a majority of 120 it has been rejected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the rafters ring with the wild cheering of the
victorious Opposition, of that strange medley of parties,
that hating each other cordially, yet hate still more
the high-souled, far-reaching, justice-loving principles
of Hector D’Estrange. Again and again the cheering
is renewed, drowning in its volume the counter-cheers
of the D’Estrangeites, wild, almost ungovernable in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>its elation, full of bitter meaning, echoing with sneering
emphasis the triumph of selfishness over right.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sits very quietly through it all, hardly seeming
to notice this outburst of the victors. He does not
grudge them their momentary triumph; his thoughts
do not dwell upon the defeat which he has just
sustained. They are far away, out beyond the portals
of the present, clasping the warm hands of the future,
reading the bright letters that twine their golden
circlet round its brow, as they flash their meaning forth
in the one word “Victory!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Be of good cheer, brave heart, for victory is at
hand!</p>

<p class='c008'>The House has adjourned; it is five minutes past
twelve. As the Prime Minister passes out he is
joined by Evie Ravensdale, who at once links his arm
within that of his friend and colleague. Although
the duke’s carriage is in waiting, these two purposely
refrain from entering it, so as to avoid the crowd
and the inevitable demonstration which would follow
recognition thereby. In this manner they escape
detection by the populace.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not entirely, however. Sharp eyes have recognised
Hector D’Estrange. He has not gone many steps
when a hand is laid on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. D’Estrange,” he hears a voice saying, “I
arrest you in the name of the law.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On what charge?” he inquires in a quick, startled
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“On the charge, sir, of murdering Lord Westray,”
is the reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a moment his quick brain has taken in the
situation, and he knows that resistance is useless.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” he answers quietly, “I will go with
you. Evie,” he adds, in a calm, composed voice
“please go at once to my poor mother.”</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Say, prisoner at the bar, are you or are you not
guilty of the murder of Lord Westray?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not guilty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The answer comes in a clear and distinct voice, a
voice in which there is neither faltering nor evasion.
It is a voice singularly rich and melodious, a voice
which one would think could not readily lie.</p>

<p class='c008'>A hum runs through the crowded court, an indescribable
buzz and movement of excitement, but there
is joy and relief on many a face, where hitherto doubt
and perplexity had reigned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The court is crowded to suffocation. All the well-known
faces of the day are present. The rush to obtain
admittance has been unprecedented, and the excitement
and popular feeling in regard to the case is
unparalleled in the annals of the law courts.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stands there very quietly, but erect as a dart.
His arms are folded on his chest, and his whole
carriage is one of easy dignity. None, looking at the
beautiful face, with its clear, radiant complexion, magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>eyes, and high, pale, thoughtful brow, around
which the old-gold curls lovingly cluster, could bring
themselves to believe that that man is a murderer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet, as we have seen, of crime so terrible Hector
D’Estrange stands accused. Since that fearful night
when, with murder in his eyes, he had burst into that
room of ill fame, and found his beloved mother in the
power and at the mercy of the man who had blighted
her early life, and who had pursued her with such
relentless vengeance, neither Hector D’Estrange nor
society at large had seen Lord Westray. As we may
remember, the former in that moment of horror and
fury had been tried to the highest pitch. A shot had
rung out through the silent house, followed by a loud
cry, and that was all.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stands accused not merely of murder, but of
having secreted the body of his victim with intent
to avoid detection. At the coroner’s inquest evidence
had been forthcoming to show how, acting upon
various anonymous communications received, the heir-at-law
of the deceased had placed the matter in the
hands of the police, who thereupon had discovered
the body and clothes of Lord Westray buried deep
in the ground at Mrs. de Lara’s residence near
Windsor. Evidence had likewise been forthcoming
to prove, that Hector D’Estrange was the last person
seen in the company of Lord Westray, and the clothes
of the murdered nobleman had been fully identified
by his valet and others as those in which he was last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>seen alive. The body was, of course, past recognition.
Two years in the earth would necessarily render it
so; yet on the skeleton little finger of one hand a
plain gold ring had been found, as also around the
skeleton’s neck a gold chain and locket, the latter
containing a faded portrait of the late Countess of
Westray, the earl’s mother. It had been proved that
Lord Westray always wore this ring, chain, and locket,
and his valet had sworn that he was wearing them
the very day on which he disappeared. Public opinion
was perplexed. Even those who would glory in
Hector D’Estrange’s innocence found it difficult to
believe him so. Everything appeared so clear against
him, so unanswerably conclusive, that men and women
shook their heads and sighed when hopes of his
acquittal were expressed. But the day of trial had
come at last, and Hector D’Estrange was there to
confront his accusers.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>In face of the terrible charge preferred against their
chief, the members of the Ministry have unconditionally
resigned, and a provisional Government, pending an
appeal to the country, has been hastily constructed
from the National party. The Government of the day
is therefore known to be rabidly antagonistic to the
late revolutionary Prime Minister, who now stands
accused of murder. The counsel retained for the
prosecution by the Crown is the Attorney-General,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>aided and assisted by two Q.C.’s, but Hector D’Estrange
has retained no one to aid him. He defends himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now with a flourish and many theatrical attitudes,
Sir Anthony Stickleback begins the case for
the prosecution. Sir Anthony is fond of rhetoric,
and he airs it to the court, fully to his own satisfaction.
He has many long-winded phrases to get
through before he closes with the main point, which
may be briefly told in his closing summary of the
statements contained in his opening address.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall therefore, my lord, call witnesses who
will speak to the evident intimacy which has existed
between Mr. D’Estrange and Mrs. de Lara through
so many years. These witnesses will be able to show
moreover, that on several occasions Mrs. de Lara
received visits from her late husband, Lord Westray,
during Mr. D’Estrange’s absence; that she was frequently
in the habit of mysteriously disappearing from
her residence near Windsor on visits to London, and
that on one of these occasions—the occasion, in fact,
when Mr. D’Estrange followed her—she actually left
a note for her maid, acquainting her with her departure.
I shall show how Mr. D’Estrange, having
surprised her in the company of Lord Westray, deliberately
fired his revolver at that nobleman. The last
thing seen of this latter unfortunate gentleman was
in the company of Mr. D’Estrange, who had announced
his intention of taking him to his home in Grosvenor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Square. It is needless to say that from that day forward
Lord Westray has never been seen in living life,
though, in consequence of several anonymous communications
received, private inquiry was set on foot
by those who have been determined to bring the
murderer to justice, and which has resulted in the
discovery of the body and the clothes which Lord
Westray was wearing when last seen, buried deep in
the earth, in the private grounds near Windsor belonging
to Mrs. de Lara. I will now, my lord, proceed to
call the witnesses for the prosecution.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And one by one the witnesses are brought forward
to swear away the life of Hector D’Estrange.</p>

<p class='c008'>Charles Weston deposes that he was for many
years Mrs. de Lara’s butler, and that he frequently
admitted Lord Westray to her house, but always in
the absence of Mr. D’Estrange. Only on one occasion
did Mr. D’Estrange come in while Lord Westray was
in the house, and he recalls high words passing between
the two, followed by the hasty departure of
Lord Westray, whose brougham was awaiting him at
Mrs. de Lara’s door. This was when she resided in
London. After this Lord Westray always came on
foot, and he, Weston, had strict orders to keep a
sharp look out for Mr. D’Estrange, so as to give the
two full warning. He remembers perfectly well bringing
Mrs. de Lara a note from Lord Westray the very
day on which she disappeared from her Windsor
residence, and the same on which Lord Westray was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>murdered, and he also remembers a note being left
that night by Mrs. de Lara for her <em>maid</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cross-examined by Hector D’Estrange. “Are you
not a discharged servant of Mrs. de Lara’s, Weston?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir,” answers this person with cool effrontery.
“I gave notice myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will swear, Weston, that Mrs. de Lara did not
dismiss you for drunkenness and gross impertinence?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly, sir. Mrs. de Lara told me I had had
too much to drink, and I told her I would leave. I
gave a month’s notice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Weston, I have no more to ask you.”
Hector D’Estrange’s voice has a peculiar ring of
unutterable contempt in it. The wretch winces as he
receives the order to “stand down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Victoire Hester is next called. She deposes to
being Mrs. de Lara’s late maid. She corroborates
Charles Weston’s evidence. Asked if she remembers
the writing paper used by Mrs. de Lara and Hector
D’Estrange, “Perfectly,” is her reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can she select a specimen from amidst the packet
of letters handed her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly,” she replies again.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a few minutes she has picked out three letters
all written in the same hand and on a similar stamp
of paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This,” she declares, “is the paper used by Mrs. de
Lara and Mr. D’Estrange all the time that I have
been in Mrs. de Lara’s service.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Asked again if she recognises the handwriting on
the letter, she unhesitatingly declares it to resemble
Lord Westray’s. Asked if she received a note from
Mrs. de Lara, acquainting her with her sudden departure
for London the night of the murder, she answers,
“<em>Yes!</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cross-examined by Hector D’Estrange.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Victoire Hester, are you not engaged to Charles
Weston, and were you not dismissed by Mrs. de
Lara?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir,” she unblushingly replies. “I gave
notice same as Charles did, because Mrs. de Lara
behaved so improperly to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Victoire Hester, you say that Mrs. de Lara left
a note for you on the night of the supposed murder
of Lord Westray, informing you she had gone to
London?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” is the reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But was she not in the habit of frequently going
up to town in the same way without leaving notes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then how is it she should trouble to do what she
had never done before, Victoire Hester?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The maid is visibly flurried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know, sir,” she stammers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Victoire.” The cold, calm, contemptuous
voice comes again, and the maid in turn steps
down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alfred Hawkins corroborates Charles Weston’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>evidence, as to driving Lord Westray to Mrs. de
Lara’s South Kensington residence on one occasion.
He states that he was groom to the late lord, and is
still so to his successor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I call for Mr. Trackem,” enunciates Sir Anthony
Stickleback in an important voice, “since the accused
does not wish to ask Alfred Hawkins any questions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Trackem enters the witness box. He is extremely
well dressed, and has an air of importance about him.
Like Sir Anthony, he has evidently a good opinion of
himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Trackem, you own a certain house in Verdegrease
Crescent, do you not?” inquires Sir Anthony
blandly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do, sir,” answers Mr. Trackem.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you or have you not admitted Mrs. de Lara
to the house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Frequently, sir,” answers that individual.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Presumably for what purpose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On each occasion, sir, to meet Lord Westray.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you, Mr. Trackem, know anything of Rita
Vernon?” asks Sir Anthony.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly, sir. She used frequently to visit my
house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you name the last two occasions you have
seen her, Mr. Trackem?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, sir, the first was on the night of the 20th of
June, 1894, and the last on the night of Lord Westray’s
murder,” answers Mr. Trackem.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Was she with any one on those two occasions?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir, each time with the same person.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And that person, Mr. Trackem, was?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Duke of Ravensdale,” answers the scoundrel
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>A movement of intense surprise pervades the
court.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you describe to his lordship and the jury all
you know about the terrible occurrence of which Lord
Westray was the victim, Mr. Trackem?” commands
Sir Anthony Stickleback, folding his arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will do my best, sir. On the afternoon of the
day on which Lord Westray disappeared, I received
a note from Mrs. de Lara, sent especially by Rita
Vernon. In this note she instructed me to retain my
house free for the night, and to admit no one but Lord
Westray. I acted as requested, and she and his lordship
arrived about half-past one. I retired to bed, there
being no one in the house but two men-servants and
a woman. The men, like myself, had retired to rest.
Suddenly I was startled by hearing a shot, followed
by a loud cry. I jumped out of bed, slipped into my
trousers, and called my two men. We proceeded to
the room in which were Lord Westray and Mrs. de
Lara. On entering, we found it in possession of
Mr. D’Estrange, the Duke of Ravensdale, and Rita
Vernon. The two latter were beside Mrs. de Lara,
who was lying on a sofa. Lord Westray was stretched
out on the floor, blood issuing from a wound in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>throat, and above him stood Mr. D’Estrange, with
a discharged revolver in his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I at once rushed up to him, and accused him of
attempting to murder Lord Westray. He replied that
he was sorry for what he had done, but that he did it
in a moment of passion. He declared that he did not
think he had seriously hurt the earl, and that he
would take him to his home if I would procure a cab.
At the same time he begged the Duke of Ravensdale
and Rita Vernon to take charge of Mrs. de Lara. I
was getting seriously alarmed at the turn affairs had
taken, and upon Lord Westray expressing a wish to
get home, I acceded to Mr. D’Estrange’s request.
Two cabs were procured. In one of them Mr.
D’Estrange and Lord Westray took their departure, in
the other Mrs. de Lara; the duke, and Rita Vernon.
I saw them off from the door, and then re-entered the
house. As I did so, I heard a groaning in a room on
the right. I procured a light and opened the door,
the key of which was turned in the lock. To my
surprise I found my woman servant laid out on the
ground, bound hand and foot with handkerchiefs, while
a third gagged her mouth. I produce these handkerchiefs
now. One has a ducal coronet on it, the other
H. D’Estrange worked on it, and the third the name
of Rita Vernon. Next day I received a letter, apparently
in Lord Westray’s writing, begging me to keep
strict silence on all that had occurred. He declared
that if it leaked out his reputation would be lost,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>and he informed me that he intended disappearing for a
couple of years, at the end of which he would return.
He enclosed me some money, and promised to continue
the donation quarterly, on condition of my silence. I
received six donations in all, and three letters. At
last the donations ceased, and I began to grow
suspicious.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What first made you suspicious?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, sir, I noticed one day that the paper on
which these letters were written was exactly similar
to the quality used by Mrs. de Lara in her note to
me on the afternoon of the day when the murder was
committed, and I also thought Lord Westray’s continued
absence after the time specified was suspicious.
Finally, I went and made a clean breast of it to the
present earl, who I found in receipt of various anonymous
communications declaring the murder, and indicating
where the body and clothes were concealed.
He employed me to find out all I could. I set to
work, sir, communicated with the police, and investigations
were set on foot, with the result as we all
know it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! you combine the work of a private detective
with your other business, do you, Mr. Trackem?”
inquires the Attorney-General graciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cross-examined by Hector D’Estrange.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you the letter which you allege Mrs. de
Lara wrote you?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“The counsel for the prosecution has it, sir,”
answers Mr. Trackem.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it not a little strange you should have preserved
that letter all these years, in view of the fact
that you thought Lord Westray alive, and is it not a
little strange that your communication to the new
Lord Westray should have been almost simultaneous
with the receipt by him of anonymous information?”
pursues the accused.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is Mr. Trackem’s turn to look confused, but he
quickly pulls himself together as he answers, “No,
I do not think so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Other witnesses are called to corroborate Mr.
Trackem’s statement in some particulars, and to testify
to the discovery of Lord Westray’s body and clothes,
the latter being produced in court, this production
causing much excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Walter Long is next called. He identifies the
chain, locket, and ring found on the skeleton as belonging
to his late master, and he also identifies the
clothes. He swears positively that Lord Westray
was wearing all these things the day he disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These, my lord,” declares Sir Anthony, “are the
witnesses for the prosecution.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And with this statement the Court adjourns for
luncheon.</p>

<p class='c008'>On reassembling, Hector D’Estrange opens the case
for the defence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall not,” he observes quietly, “detain the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Court at any length with my opening statement. I
have been charged with undue intimacy with Mrs. de
Lara. The charge is stupid and disgusting, and when
I inform your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury
that Mrs. de Lara is my mother, this will at once be
evident, and show the groundlessness of the charge.
I deny the statement that Lord Westray was a
frequent and admitted visitor at my mother’s house,
though he made many endeavours to be one. Only
once he obtained ingress, and was ordered out both by
Mrs. de Lara and myself. He has been the curse of
my mother’s life. The sufferings of Lady Altai must
be green in the memory of many, while the fate that
befell my father at his hands is matter of history.
I shall call Mrs. de Lara, who will deny having
written either to Mr. Trackem or to her maid. She
will explain how these so-called mysterious visits
to London were solely to see her child. She will
describe to you how it was her custom to walk out
at night in her grounds at Windsor, and how on the
evening of the day on which I am accused of murdering
Lord Westray, she was set upon by two men,
gagged, bound hand and foot, transferred to a carriage,
and taken in it to London, where, at the house of Mr.
Trackem, she was handed over to the mercy of Lord
Westray, from whom God in His mercy enabled me
to rescue her in time. This evidence will be corroborated
by Rita Vernon, who will explain all she was
eyewitness to. She will tell you how she clung to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the back of the brougham which contained Mrs. de
Lara all the way to London, and having taken note
of the house—which, alas! she knew too well—hurried
to Montragee House to apprise the Duke of Ravensdale,
whom she knew to be my dear friend, of the
terrible occurrence. There she happily found both
him and myself, and we at once proceeded to my
mother’s rescue. Effecting an entrance into the
house, we gagged and bound the woman who let us
in, and then, guided by Rita Vernon, stole noiselessly
upstairs to what Rita styled the best room. On
reaching the door she halted, and bade me listen to
a voice, which I recognised as that of Lord Westray’s.
Mad with fury, I dashed open the door—what to find?
Why my mother, gagged and bound, a prisoner in the
hands of the scoundrel who had wrecked and ruined
her life. My lord, would not the sight have driven
you mad? I drew my revolver, and shot him where
he stood. He uttered a cry and fell. Quickly the
duke and I cut the thongs that bound my mother.
Her hands were cramped and saturated with blood,
across both palms extending a ghastly gash. We
carried her tenderly downstairs, procured a cab, and
in Rita Vernon’s and the Duke of Ravensdale’s kind
care she was transferred to Montragee House. I then
went back to the room where Lord Westray was lying,
where I found him alone with Mr. Trackem. I
offered to call the police and state what had occurred.
Lord Westray was seated on the sofa, and begged me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>not to do so. He declared the wound was nothing,
and requested me to leave him, and on no account to
disclose what had occurred. For my mother’s sake, and
yet on another account, I agreed. Next day I called
upon Mr. Trackem, who informed me of the letter he
had received from Lord Westray, the contents of
which he has communicated in his evidence to-day.
I regret, however, to have to say that the greater part
of the remainder of his evidence has been falsely
given, why, I am at a loss to understand, as beyond
the encounter in the house in Verdegrease Crescent,
I had no quarrel with him whatsoever. I propose
now to call my witnesses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. de Lara is called. Her appearance in court
excites the greatest interest. For though few have
seen the beautiful Lady Altai of former days, the
story of her marriage, her flight with Harry Kintore,
and the tragic sequel in which Lord Westray figured
so prominently, is well known in Society. So this is
Speranza de Lara, mother of Hector D’Estrange?</p>

<p class='c008'>“No wonder he is handsome, with such a mother
as that!” gasps Mrs. de Lacy Trevor. “Dodo dear,
it’s the same lovely woman we met him riding with
on the Burton Course long ago, at Melton, don’t you
remember? The mystery’s cleared at last.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stops abruptly and stares at her friend, for
Lady Manderton is scarcely heeding her, and there are
large tears in her fine, handsome eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, what is the matter, Dodo?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“Nothing, Vivi, nothing! There, don’t attract
attention,” she answers hastily.</p>

<p class='c008'>She is thinking though, how wasted has been her
life. She has heard Hector D’Estrange’s statement,
and believes it implicitly. She is thinking that others
may not, though. If Hector D’Estrange is condemned,
well, Dodo Manderton feels that she would
die to save him.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Mrs. de Lara,” queries Hector D’Estrange, in
a voice in which respect and tenderness are
mingled, “you have heard the statement for the
prosecution in which you and I are accused of undue
intimacy? You have heard my reply, in which I
declare you to be my mother? Which statement is
correct?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yours,” she replies in a firm, clear voice. “I am
your mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And my father?” he again asks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was Captain Harry Kintore.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Both Weston and Victoire state that they gave
you a month’s notice. Is this a fact?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not,” she replies firmly; “it was I who gave
it to them. To Weston for being drunk and impertinent,
to Victoire for the latter fault.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is stated by Weston that you were in the habit
of receiving frequent visits from Lord Westray? Is
this so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not,” she answers quickly; “the statement is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>a wicked falsehood. Only once he obtained admittance,
when he came to insult me with the proposal
that I should re-marry him and forget the past. You
came in when he was there, and requested him to
leave the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did he do so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“At once,” she replies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Since then have you been annoyed by his presence,
or in any other way?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By his presence, no, until the night on which he
is alleged to have been murdered, but by letters,
yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have kept or destroyed those letters?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Every one is destroyed!” she replies almost
fiercely; “most of them unopened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you remember the date when Rita Vernon
first came to you, and who sent her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, well,” answers Speranza. “It was the
21st of June, 1894. She brought a letter from you,
written at the instance of the Duke of Ravensdale.
I at once made her my secretary and general amanuensis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has she served you faithfully?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“None more so,” she replies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. de Lara, you have heard Mr. Trackem’s
statement, that you sent her with a note to him on
the day of the supposed murder. Is this true, or
false?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“False!” she replies sternly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“And you have heard Victoire’s declaration that
you left a letter for her, apprising her of your departure
for London the night of the supposed murder.
Is this true?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not,” she answers. “I wrote no letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you give his lordship and the gentlemen of
the jury your version of what occurred on the night
in question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She gives it in a firm, clear voice, without hesitation
or faltering. She tells the facts as we have
described them in a former chapter. A shudder runs
through the court at their mere recital. Is it possible
that such horrors reflect the truth? Sir Anthony
smiles superciliously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hallucination,” he mutters audibly. “Many women
are subject to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looks at him contemptuously, but scorns to
further notice the great man’s brutality.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You swear, Mrs. de Lara, that what you have
stated is absolutely correct?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Absolutely,” she answers calmly; “I swear it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will swear that you were not in the habit of
receiving Lord Westray, Mrs. de Lara? Now, pray
be careful, very careful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the same contemptuous glance, as she proudly
replies, “I swear it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you mean to say that you never sent Rita
Vernon with a letter to Mr. Trackem, or left a note
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>for Victoire Hester on the day of Lord Westray’s
murder? Again I ask you to be careful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did not!” is her fierce reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Anthony puts his hands on his hips. There is
a self-satisfied smile on his face as he glances round
the court, but he questions no further.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have no more to ask the witness,” he remarks
jauntily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rita Vernon is next called and questioned. She
describes her first meeting with the Duke of Ravensdale,
and what followed. She gives in simple, unaffected
language the story of the attack on Speranza and the
part she played in it. Again Sir Anthony is heard to
mutter the word “hallucination.” He has no questions
to put to the witness—yet stay—as she is about
to leave the box he jumps up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One moment please, Miss Vernon,” he remarks
in a suave voice. “I presume, of course, that you
are grateful to the Duke of Ravensdale for all his
kindness?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a flash in her grey eyes, but she answers
quietly,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Need you ask it, sir? I would die for his Grace.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next witness is the duke himself. He corroborates
the statements made by Hector D’Estrange,
Speranza de Lara, and Rita Vernon. His evidence is
listened to with marked attention, and the keenest
interest by the Court. Sir Anthony does not cross-examine
him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>As he steps down, Hector D’Estrange’s voice is
heard speaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have one more witness to call,” he is saying.
“This will be my last, my lord. I call for Dr.
Merioneth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A white-haired man enters the box and is sworn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dr. Merioneth, do you recall attending Mrs. de
Lara many years ago?” inquires the accused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do,” replies the witness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you state for what purpose, and how many
years have elapsed since then?” is the next question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I attended Mrs. de Lara in her confinement, and
it is twenty-eight years ago,” answers the old doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where, Dr. Merioneth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“At Ancona, sir, on the Adriatic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The child was born well and healthy, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A beautiful child indeed,” replies the doctor. “I
wish all children resembled it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Dr. Merioneth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stay, I have a word, please, to put to you,” exclaims
the Attorney-General, jumping up. “You have not
told us the sex of the child, doctor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment the old man hesitates. Then he
looks sadly at the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A girl it was,” he replies in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! a girl you say?” echoes the counsel for the
prosecution in a loud voice, as he looks round the
court with a knowing air. “Thank you, doctor. I
am greatly obliged to you for that information.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>This concludes the evidence for the defence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Sir Anthony rises slowly and portentously.
His hands are behind him, he leans perilously forward,
and his gown is stuck out behind like a lady’s dress-improver.
He appears thoroughly satisfied with the
appearance of importance which he believes this
attitude gives him, but it is not so certain that others
share that opinion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My lord, and gentlemen of the jury,” he begins
in a somewhat pompous voice, “the case before us
is a very peculiar one, yet I hope to detain you at
very little length in reviewing it. The prisoner, Mr.
D’Estrange, is accused of a base and horrible murder,
and it is my painful duty to endeavour to bring home
to the jury the absolute certainty of his guilt. It will
be necessary in so doing to show motive for the crime,
and I think I shall be able to point to this motive as
conclusive, jealousy prompting and being at the bottom
of it. It is now, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury,
nigh on thirty years ago that Mrs. de Lara, then
known as Lady Altai, broke faith with her husband,
whom in wedding she had sworn to love, honour, and
obey, and shamelessly fled with her lover, Captain
Harry Kintore. It is known that Lord Altai, who
was devoted to his wife, pursued the two, coming up
with them at Ancona. Here, having confronted them,
a fierce dispute ensued. It is said that Captain
Kintore drew a revolver, and in self-defence Lord
Altai fired at him, unfortunately with fatal effect.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>I wish to dwell as lightly as possible upon a matter
so terrible, and therefore pass on to the next event
in this painful story, namely, the birth of a child.
Dr. Merioneth has been called, ostensibly to bear
witness to that birth. Unfortunately he has marred
the case for the defence by informing us that the child
to which Mrs. de Lara gave birth was a female. Now,
my lord, one of the chief points of Mr. D’Estrange’s
defence is, that the intimacy which we declare has
existed between him and this lady for so long a time
is impossible, inasmuch as Mrs. de Lara is his mother.
She has herself so stated this, and furthermore pointed
to Captain Kintore as being Mr. D’Estrange’s father.
This statement must fall to the ground in face of what
Dr. Merioneth has told us. So much for that portion
of the defence, as I do not suppose Mr. D’Estrange
is going to pose before us as a woman. It would
appear that Mrs. de Lara is not averse to this mode
of life. She married Lord Altai by her own free will.
Next we find her leaving him and electing a new lover
in the person of Captain Kintore, and of late years
we have direct evidence that Mr. D’Estrange has been
the favoured man. Yet not only this, but the evidence
sworn to by Charles Weston, Victoire Hester, and
Mr. Trackem points to the existence of a secret intimacy
carried on by this lady with her divorced husband,
Lord Westray. Both she and Mr. D’Estrange now
tell us that only once did the late earl obtain admission
to Mrs. de Lara’s house, and then it was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>opposition to the latter’s wishes. I leave you to judge
if this statement be possible of either acceptance or
belief, in face of what the witnesses referred to have
told us.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have heard some evidence likewise of the way
in which Rita Vernon became introduced into Mrs.
de Lara’s household. It appears that she was formerly
no novice to Mr. Trackem’s house. She does not deny
this. In fact, how could she? Does it not strike you,
gentlemen, that Rita Vernon was just a peculiar class
of young woman to put in the responsible position
described by Mrs. de Lara, and does it not seem very
clear that the use to which her services were put was
of a totally different nature? We were told distinctly
by Mr. Trackem that Mrs. de Lara sent him a note
by Rita Vernon on the day of the murder, instructing
him to retain his house for her and Lord Westray.
Mrs. de Lara denies having written this note. I
produce it, and it runs as follows:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—Please to reserve the house to-night as
usual for Lord Westray and myself. We shall arrive
between twelve and one.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>S. de Lara.</span>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“What is to be thought, my lord, of the veracity of
such witnesses as Mrs. de Lara and Rita Vernon, for
the girl denies having delivered this note? Yet here
we have it, and we have furthermore the fact, that on
the night when Mr. D’Estrange shot Lord Westray,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Mrs. de Lara was found alone with that nobleman in
Mr. Trackem’s house. And, gentlemen, as against
this very clear and circumstantial evidence, we are
asked by Mrs. de Lara and Rita Vernon to accept a
romance which all sane men can only regard in the
light of hallucination, if not, as I regret to believe, downright
deliberate falsehood. We are asked to believe
that Mrs. de Lara was waylaid in her own grounds at
night, overcome by ruffians, and carried off bound hand
and foot to London. We are asked to believe that a
slight, frail girl like Rita Vernon performed a task
which a man of herculean strength would have found
almost beyond his power to accomplish. We are
asked, in fact, to believe that Rita Vernon, whom you
have had an opportunity of seeing, could cling to a
brougham between Windsor and London, and then
sum up sufficient force to make her way to Montragee
House at half-past two in the morning, where of course,
like in a fairy tale, she finds the Duke of Ravensdale
and Mr. D’Estrange all ready to accompany her to the
release of the lady fair. The story defeats its own
end by its wild improbability, unsupported by fact,
and establishes at once the reasonable and circumstantial
evidence of the side for the prosecution. I maintain
that there is proof positive that Mr. D’Estrange,
assisted by Rita Vernon,—who in this instance betrayed
her mistress,—came upon the unfortunate earl with
intent to murder. He admits that he shot him, but
he declines to give any further information as to what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>he did with Lord Westray after leaving the house in
Verdegrease Crescent. We find, moreover, that the
three letters purporting to come from Lord Westray,
and addressed to Mr. Trackem, are all written on
paper which Victoire Hester has identified as the
quality and class always used by Mr. D’Estrange and
Mrs. de Lara, and exactly similar to the paper on
which the notes to Mr. Trackem and Victoire Hester
were penned on the day of the murder. The writing
of the last note is denied. Again I meet that denial
by producing the note. It runs thus:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘<span class='sc'>Hester</span>,—I have gone up to town for a few days,
will let you know when to expect me back. Miss
Vernon has accompanied me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Faithfully yours,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“‘<span class='sc'>S. de Lara</span>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Such facts leave very little doubt in my mind but
that Mrs. de Lara had arranged to meet Lord Westray,
and that Rita Vernon betrayed her intention to Mr.
D’Estrange. Such facts convince me that this latter resolved
on vengeance. He deliberately went to Verdegrease
Crescent, and shot Lord Westray, and finally,
under cover of repentance, decoyed him from the house,
and got rid of him somehow and somewhere. What
follows? A letter arrives for Mr. Trackem, who is
frightened out of his wits at the turn affairs have
taken—a letter, purporting to come from Lord Westray.
By a strange coincidence, this letter and others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>following are all written on the same class of paper
as that used by Mr. D’Estrange in Mrs. de Lara’s
house. Lastly, the very suit which Lord Westray was
known to have been wearing the night he was shot
at, has been found buried deep in the ground on the
property of Mrs. de Lara at Windsor, bearing evidence
of having been a long time under the earth, and in
close proximity to it the body of a man reduced to a
skeleton was also discovered. Around the neck of
this skeleton a gold chain and locket was found, and
on the little finger a plain gold ring. These have
been identified by the late earl’s valet, who has
sworn to seeing them on the earl’s person the day he
disappeared. It would be superfluous for me to detain
you with further details, the points of evidence which
I have submitted being, it appears to me, too clear for
it to be possible to draw any other conclusion but the
one that Mr. D’Estrange deliberately, and of malice
aforethought, did shoot at Lord Westray with intent
to kill, and did afterwards, in some manner not yet
unravelled, make away with the life of that unfortunate
nobleman. I ask you, therefore, to put aside from
your minds Mr. D’Estrange’s high position and social
status, and to find a verdict in accordance with the
evidence before you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The great man sits down hastily, and glances round
the court. An almost unnatural stillness reigns
therein. Every eye is bent on the prisoner, and then
on the beautiful, pale, gold-headed woman, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>gaze is riveted on her child’s face with an intensity
terrible to witness. But there is nothing but calmness
on the features of Hector D’Estrange, in whose
eyes the confident, triumphant expression shines, which
conscious innocence alone could create.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will endeavour, like the Attorney-General,” he
observes, “to detain the Court as shortly as possible.
But at the very outset I would wish to point out to
you that the evidence of Weston and Victoire is not
trustworthy, as being that of discharged servants.
Mrs. de Lara has told you most emphatically that
Lord Westray paid her no visits, save the one referred
to by the coachman, Alfred Hawkins. She has told
you how that visit was forced upon her, and how Lord
Westray was ordered out of the house by myself.
There is absolutely no evidence corroborative of that
given by Charles Weston, which I can only characterise
as pure and malicious invention, the same remark
applying to the false testimony of Victoire Hester.
This woman has declared that Mrs. de Lara wrote her
a note the night of the supposed murder apprising her
of her visit to London. Yet these visits with Mrs. de
Lara were of frequent occurrence, and she had never
before found it necessary to acquaint Victoire of her
movements. My lord, I declare the letter to be
a forgery, as I also declare the letter to which Mr.
Trackem refers as coming from Mrs. de Lara to be
likewise. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, the
Attorney-General has passed a cruel and unnecessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>sneer on Mrs. de Lara’s account of the ruffianly and
brutal attack made upon her by the undoubtedly hired
scoundrels of her most bitter foe. He has attributed
all to romance, hallucination, deliberate falsehood.
His insinuations are brutal and cowardly. My mother,
like myself, <em>would scorn to tell a lie</em>. We leave that
to the poltroons and cowards who seek by forgery and
perjury to swear away the life of one who is innocent.
I maintain that Mrs. de Lara’s account and description
of what took place is in every essential particular true,
while the corroborative evidence of Rita Vernon bears
it out in every detail. The Duke of Ravensdale has
clearly stated to you how the poor girl sought him at
Montragee House, and the state she was in after her
terrible drive. The Attorney-General smiles scornfully
at the idea of a woman being capable of such pluck
and heroism as Rita Vernon evinced on that occasion.
I cast back the slur into his teeth. I tell him that if
he wishes to find true courage and heroism combined,
he must go to a woman to discover it. But it is not
to such as he, that women will go for justice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I
ask you to put yourselves in my place. Had you been
called to that house of ill fame, and there found a
being whom you honoured, loved, and respected, in
the hands and power of her bitterest enemy, bound
hand and foot, gagged, bleeding, and helpless, would
you not have acted as I did, and in the fury and horror
of the moment lost all power of restraint? I admit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>that I shot Lord Westray; I have never denied it. But
I do deny that I caused his death; and what is more,
<em>I confidently believe that he is alive at this moment</em>,
and that this foul accusation is a plot to ruin me, to be,
in fact, revenged on yonder noble lady, who has through
life resented his brutality, defied and scouted him, and
refused to submit to his hideous desires. I make no
pretence of being able to account for his disappearance,
for the alleged discovery of his body and clothes, for
the letters written in his handwriting on the paper used
by myself and Mrs. de Lara. I am unable to understand
it all save in the light of a base, foul, and
detestable plot which has for its object revenge. Of
that I know him to be perfectly capable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I
have but one more statement to make ere I close these
remarks. I once more positively affirm that Mrs. de
Lara is my mother, and that the intimacy of which I
am accused is a base and unfounded fabrication.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He has folded his arms, and his voice has ceased.
A burst of applause greets him as he stops speaking.
Vainly the judge calls for order.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is an exhibition that I will not tolerate,”
exclaims that worthy functionary. “Another such a
disgraceful proceeding, and I will cause the whole court
to be instantly cleared.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This produces silence. Sir James Grumpy is a bit
of a martinet. The public knows that he means what
he says.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>And now he proceeds in his summing up. Very
carefully he goes over all the points advanced by both
sides, but it is apparent to all, from the first, that the
summing up is most unfavourable to the accused.
It takes him about an hour to get through his task,
and all the time Hector D’Estrange stands motionless,
with folded arms and immovable features. Only now
and again the dark blue eyes wander to where
Speranza is sitting, with the Duke of Ravensdale by
her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>The summing up is over at length, and the jury
have retired to consider their verdict. Apparently,
however, they had made up their minds beforehand,
for they do not keep the Court long waiting. In a few
minutes every one has reassembled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gentlemen of the jury, have you considered your
verdict?” rings out a harsh, sing-song voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have,” answers the foreman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You find the accused guilty or not guilty of the
murder of Lord Westray?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Amidst a silence, terrible in its intensity, comes the
answer—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guilty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A thrill of horror runs through the court. There
is hardly a dry eye within it. The duke has got
Speranza’s hand in his, but she never moves.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hector D’Estrange, have you any reason to give
why sentence of death should not be passed upon
you?” again inquires the harsh, sing-song voice.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“I have,” he answers, with a low musical laugh.
“My reason is, that if I am put to death, murder will
indeed be committed, for I am guiltless. I wish to
add also one word of explanation, for I see the time
has come. Both Sir Anthony and the learned judge
have laid great stress on the apparent falsehood of
which they allege I have been guilty, in declaring that
I am the child of Captain Harry Kintore and Mrs.
de Lara. They point to the fact that Dr. Merioneth
has declared that the child born at Ancona was a girl.
Has it never struck you, my lord, and gentlemen of
the jury, that a girl could do what I have done in
youth, a woman accomplish what I have accomplished
in maturer years? No. I plainly see that this has
not struck you, for you are men. You will not acknowledge
that a woman can equal man, and with fair
opportunities rise to power and fame. Yet such has
been my aim in life to prove, for this I have struggled;
and had it not been for the base machinations of
enemies, would assuredly have lived to triumphantly
achieve. Know, however, that Hector D’Estrange is
no liar. If for sixteen years he has practised on
Society what may be called a fraud, it was for the sake
of righting a terrible wrong. My lord, and gentlemen
of the jury, I again declare myself to be the child of
Captain Kintore and Mrs. de Lara, but I confess my
sex. In Hector D’Estrange the world beholds a
woman—her name, Gloria de Lara.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Amidst confusion and excitement unparalleled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>sentence of death is passed. Yet, as the judge’s
words come to a close, a voice rings through the
court, a voice in which defiance and love are mingled.
It is a woman’s voice. Many recognise it as Flora
Desmond’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As there is a God above,” it cries, “Gloria de
Lara shall not die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But even as all eyes are turned in search of the
speaker, Flora Desmond has vanished.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
<img src='images/i_175.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>
<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Guilty!” “Condemned to death!” “Hector
D’Estrange a woman!” The words have passed
through the court, along the corridors, and out into the
street beyond, where the crowds press eagerly forward
to hear the news. It is received at first with astonishment
and incredulity. Some people call it a hoax,
others laugh at the statement as a wild improbability,
and wonder what the real truth is. But even as they
discuss the rumour, a movement is visible opposite
the court, as an officer of the White Guards’ Regiment
makes her appearance outside. An orderly mounted
on a grey horse is holding an empty-saddled white one
in readiness, and as the officer makes her appearance,
brings the steed alongside the steps leading up to the
entrance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The officer is no stranger to the crowd. Flora
Desmond’s features are well known to it. Is she
not the leader of Hector D’Estrange’s especial regiment,
a regiment entirely drawn from the women of
“the people”? Whatever may be the feeling of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>middle class and a portion of that one which claims
to rank above it, in regard to Hector D’Estrange, one
thing is certain, that amidst the poor and the needy,
amidst the suffering and the struggling, that name is
a talisman to conjure by.</p>

<p class='c008'>She comes down the steps hurriedly, and mounts
her horse in haste. The crowd sways and presses
towards her in spite of the efforts of large numbers
of police to repress them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The verdict?” they shout inquiringly. “Tell us
the verdict!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stands up in her stirrups and looks at that
sea of faces. Enemies there may be amongst them,
hundreds, perhaps, antagonistic to Hector D’Estrange,
but amidst the rough faces of the thousands that press
around her, she knows that the majority are true as
steel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guilty!” she calls out. “He is condemned to die!
I mistake the people, however, if they will believe the
verdict or acquiesce in the sentence. Say you, whom
he loves, whose hard lot he has struggled to raise, will
you permit it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never!” comes the fierce shout from hundreds,
nay, thousands of throats. “Hector D’Estrange shall
not die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I knew it,” she replies proudly. “Justice shall be
upheld. I knew the people would be true to him,
men as well as women. He shall not die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They cheer and cheer again as she makes her way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>through the crowd followed by her orderly. It gives
room to her willingly, and opens a passage for her
horse. She rides along rapidly in the direction of
a quiet side street, well away from the thronging
crowd of people. Even as she does so the rumbling
wheels of the prison-van strike on her ear. She can
see it approaching, surrounded by a strong force
of police, and as she does so, she urges on her
horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Flora Desmond passes rapidly along the quiet,
deserted street, until she nearly reaches the end, and
then turns her horse down a narrow alley leading
therefrom. This brings her into a wide, spacious
yard, around which a big square building is built, in
the centre of which is a large archway with strong
iron gates, guarded by two mounted sentries. They
salute her as she rides up, and the iron gates are
unlocked at once. She rides through them, and
enters what appears to be an immense riding-school,
in which are drawn up a hundred troopers of the
White Regiment. Her eye scans them keenly and
rapidly. They are in perfect order, and look fit for
any work. Every face is turned towards her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hector D’Estrange has been declared guilty,” she
says in a clear, distinct voice, “and is condemned to
die! I am here to lead you to his rescue. If any
one is to die, it shall be we who will do so, not him.
Follow me, guards. There is not a moment to be
lost.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>She places herself at their head. They pass out
into the courtyard, and the gates are locked behind
them. The sentries fall into their places, and the
troopers, six abreast, follow in the wake of their
gallant-hearted leader. At a smart trot they pass
down the quiet street. In the distance they can hear
the roar of the crowd, which is cheering loudly; and
they know that Hector D’Estrange is being removed
to the prison from which his accusers hope never again
to see him issue.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are nearing the crowd now, for it is surging
their way. The prison-van is coming along at a smart
pace, guarded by its bevy of policemen. It is not a
hundred yards from where Flora Desmond, at the
head of her hundred and two guards, sits motionless
on her horse, for she has called a halt, and is awaiting
their coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly she stands up in her stirrups and turns
to her troopers. At the same moment she draws her
sword.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forward!” she cries, waving it above her head.
“Forward, guards of <em>his</em> regiment; rescue him or
die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She has put her horse in motion as she speaks,
and with the rush of a whirlwind the White Guards
bear down upon the prison-van. The policemen catch
sight of them coming, and close around it manfully.
The driver whips up the horses, and urges them along
at a canter. “Of what avail?” The White Guards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>are upon them; nothing can withstand the charge.
It is the work of a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sever the traces; cut the horses loose!” shouts
Flora Desmond, as she gallops up alongside one of
the animals, and, seizing its rein, brings it up on to
its haunches, one of the troopers doing likewise by
the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>They obey her promptly and rapidly, while the
remainder engage the police escort, who resist gallantly.
“Of what avail?” The crowd has closed round,
willing and eager to assist in the work of rescue. The
odds are too great to allow the representatives of law
and order to prevail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Twice over Flora Desmond has summoned the
policeman inside to unlock the door of the van, but
he stands to his guns and refuses. “If you do not,”
she cries, “I shall be forced to fire through the lock
until I break it, and the bullets may injure you. Come,
man, no use resisting now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the policeman is staunch in the performance
of what he considers his duty, and remains firm in
his determination not to betray his trust.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then throw yourself flat on the ground, my man,”
again calls out Flora Desmond, “for I am going to
fire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She pauses for a moment to give him time to obey,
then raises a revolver, and fires once, twice, thrice
through the lock, which gives way at last. The
crowd cheers loudly, the door of the van is flung
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>open, and in a moment Flora Desmond is beside
Gloria de Lara.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank God!” she exclaims. “Here, come this
way. I have a horse all ready for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The policeman is lying motionless on the floor of
the van. The two step across him, and pass quickly
out of the wheeled prison. As they do so the people
press forward to welcome their hero, for to them, in
spite of the rumours, Gloria de Lara is still Hector
D’Estrange. She has mounted her horse, and raised
her hand to enjoin silence. The police escort has
been overcome; its members are passively accepting
what to them is the inevitable. They have sought
to do their duty. They can do no more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Friends,” she calls out in the voice they know
and love so well, “I have been unjustly accused and
unjustly condemned. If it were not so, I would not
accept the rescue brought me by my faithful women
guards, aided by your kindly and generous devotion.
My enemies are those who would fight against true
progress, and the abolition of scandals and wrongs
which must destroy this great nation with their wickedness,
unless abolished in time. I have sought to
probe to their root these scandals and these wrongs,
have sought to submit to you the quickest and surest
way to remedy them. I tell you that the greatest
evils we have to face are the social ones. To them
I ascribe all the sufferings and sins of the poor, the
sins and false position of the rich. There are bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>laws which must be done away with, good ones which
must be set up to accomplish such social reform.
Before you can do this you must set Nature on an
even footing, and do away with the artificial barriers
which you have raised against woman’s progress and
advancement; for until she has the same powers
and opportunities as man, a thorough and exhaustive
reform of the evils which afflict Society, will never
be efficiently undertaken.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, my friends, we are on the eve of a great
revolution. If the people will stand by me, I will
stand by them. Let us loyally determine to carry
this great question to a successful issue, nor rest till
it has been accomplished. I am going to trust myself
amongst those whom I have ever loved, whose condition
I have sought to raise. Yet ere doing so, I
have one confession to make to you. Hector D’Estrange,
whose advancement has been rapid and unparalleled
almost in the annals of statesmanship, must be no
longer known to you under that name. The time has
come when I must confess myself. Before you you
see one of the despised and feeble sex, the unfitted
to rule, the inferior of man. <em>I am a woman!</em> Henceforth
I am no longer Hector D’Estrange, but Gloria
de Lara.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She has ceased speaking, and begun to move her
horse through the crowd. Men and women press
round her to kiss her hand. Poor men are more
generous than rich ones. With rare exceptions, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>fire of suffering purifies from self, and makes the heart
appreciate true worth more readily. It is the people’s
voice that generally forces on all great reforms; it is
the people’s will that carries everything before it,
when the reform required is a just one.</p>

<p class='c008'>It never enters these men’s minds to depreciate her
deeds, to belittle her acts, because she is a woman.
Their reason tells them that she understands their
wants, that her great heart is in sympathy with their
needs, that she has sought to help them when in
power, and that now her enemies have got the upper
hand, all their loyalty and devotion is needed to
support the cause, which she has told them lies at
the root of all future social reform, which means
progress, comfort, and happiness for the toiling millions.
But there is a sound of many horses’ feet coming
towards them, and all eyes are turned in the direction
whence the sounds come. The ever-increasing crowd
sways to and fro, expectant and anxious, instinctively
apprehending what is to come.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Form up, guards!” Flora Desmond’s voice is
heard shouting. “Close round her, and defend her
with your lives. It is not we who seek to spill blood,
but if our rulers will have it so, then let it be. We
will show them that woman is not the helpless coward
they imagine. If necessary, we will fight to save her.
Retreat in good order on Montragee House.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They close round her, obedient to the order. The
movement is executed silently but swiftly, and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>an exactitude which speaks volumes for the discipline
of the White Guards. “Shade of Whyte-Melville,”
could ye arise now, you would behold your prophecy
an accomplished fact, for the Amazons, whom you
predicted, if rendered amenable to discipline, could
conquer the world, are before you there. The sounds
have assumed shape, and a troop of Horse Guards
Blue, hastily turned out to support the arm of the
law, are in view now. The horses have been ridden
at a good pace, for the foam studs their black shining
coats. At the word of command the troopers rein up.</p>

<p class='c008'>The position is a difficult one. Between them and
the White Guards a dense, impenetrable crowd is surging.
To charge that crowd means death to many, yet
it can only be compassed in this manner. The order
which the officer in command has received is, however,
specific. It is to disperse the crowd, to give every
assistance to the police, and to recapture the prisoner
at any cost.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a soldier’s duty to obey superior orders, nor
question the why or wherefore. It is no part of a
soldier’s duty to use his own discretion.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“His not to reason why,</div>
      <div class='line'>His but to do and die.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So at least thinks Colonel Jack Delamere, as his
quick eye takes in the scene. Duty is a strange thing.
It nerves the heart not only to physical but to moral
deeds of courage. Surely it is no insignificant act of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the latter which draws from that gallant officer the
command to obey an order which he loathes, for, apart
from all other considerations, Jack Delamere loves
Flora Desmond, and knowing her as he does, he is
aware that the order will probably mean death to the
being for whom he would willingly sacrifice his own
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make way, my friends,” he calls out imploringly
to the people. “Make way, I beseech of you. My
orders are to disperse the crowd, and I must obey
them. If you do not make way, I shall be forced to
order my men to charge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A loud shout of defiance is the only reply which he
receives. There are heroes and heroines in that crowd.
They are resolved that only over their trampled and
crushed bodies, shall Jack Delamere and his Blues
come up with the White Guards, who are retreating in
good order with Gloria de Lara in their midst. Every
minute is precious for this latter, and the crowd will
do its best to afford these precious minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a tremor in Jack Delamere’s voice as he
once more puts his request. The crowd mistake it for
a sign of anger, and defy him with jeers and sneers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then be it so,” he says sadly, as with a heavy
heart he gives the order which must bring death to
many.</p>

<p class='c008'>His men obey. The black horses charge into the
swaying mass, and men and women go down before
them. Some make a desperate fight for it before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>they succumb, clinging to the animals’ bridles, and
attempting to force them back from their onward
career. But the troopers have their swords out, and
the unarmed cannot prevail over the armed. Nevertheless
there is no surrender, no cry for quarter or
mercy. The crowd are in earnest in their desire to let
the White Guards get away with their beloved charge,
and their resistance is dogged and determined.</p>

<p class='c008'>The police have joined in, and are using their batons
freely. Shouts and cries resound, and the crowd grows
denser every moment, swelled by the numbers that
have hastened to the scene. Dead and dying are
lying on the cold stone pavements of the street.
Even the latter are forgotten in the fierce fight that
is raging, a fight undertaken by the people that the
idol of their hearts may live.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is an unequal contest, and can only end one way.
Nigh every trooper has cut his way through at the
expense of many a life. They are re-forming now, and
with Jack Delamere at their head set off in pursuit of
the White Guards, the crowd following as best it can
in the rear.</p>

<p class='c008'>But its devotion and sturdy resistance have given the
start to Gloria de Lara’s escort, and ride as they may,
the Blues on their black horses cannot come up with
the lightly mounted greys of the White Guards.
These flash along Whitehall at full speed, with their
precious charge in their midst. Another moment,
and the hoofs of the horses are clattering through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>entrance to Montragee House. It is the work of an
instant for the great folding doors to unclose. Once
through them, and Gloria de Lara is safe. Flora
Desmond has laid her hand on the bridle of this
latter’s horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quick!” she exclaims. “Pass in there, Gloria.
Ah! do not delay. Remember that your life means
liberty to thousands. It is not a question of self. I
know well how you would wish to stay and help us,
but your duty is to preserve your life first. No one
doubts your courage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“God bless you, Flora! Yes, I will do my duty, for
the sake of the great cause that shall triumph.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She springs from her horse as she speaks, and
as one of the troopers leads it towards the stables, she
turns to the others. “Brave guards,” she exclaims,
“none know better than you that Gloria de Lara is
grateful for your devotion and staunch loyalty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We would die for you!” they shout enthusiastically,
and many of their voices tremble. Even as they
cease, the Duke of Ravensdale is on the threshold of
his noble mansion. His hand is on Gloria’s arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Great God be praised!” bursts from his white
lips. “Gloria, they shall never touch you here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He draws her gently into the great front hall, and
the door is closed and barred behind them. There is
a triumphant smile on Flora Desmond’s features; her
quick ear has caught the sound of galloping horses.
“Do you hear them?” she laughs defiantly. “They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>come too late. Brave people! They have done their
part well, and she is saved. Now follow me, guards.
She has no need of us just yet. We must seek a
safety for the future good that we may do, and for the
sake of the cause we love. There is work ahead of
us—hard work, and plenty too, for the revolution has
begun!”</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“My dear, how did you ever manage to get here?
How could you venture out? Isn’t it terrible,
my dear?” exclaims Mrs. de Lacy Trevor, as her
friend Lady Manderton enters her boudoir in the snug
Piccadilly mansion, already introduced to the reader,
on the morning following upon the events related in
the last chapter. Outside, the streets are filled with
an angry and excited crowd. The rougher element
have taken advantage of the <i><span lang="fr">mêlée</span></i>, to introduce themselves
into its midst, and are parading the streets,
causing confusion and terror to the more respectable
and orderly portion of the crowd, whose presence is to
be accounted for by totally different circumstances to
those which have attracted the irredeemable portion
of Society. The news of the verdict and sentence on
Hector D’Estrange, the confession as to sex of the
late Prime Minister, the daring and masterly rescue of
the prisoner by Flora Desmond and her White Guards,
the devoted resistance of the crowd to the charge of
the Blues under Colonel Delamere, and the ultimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>escape of Gloria de Lara from her pursuers, has spread
like wild-fire through the metropolis. London has
been in a state of the greatest excitement throughout
the night. The most startling and improbable rumours
have been afloat as to the intentions of the Government,
while the people are loudly clamouring for a
squashing of the verdict, an annulment of the sentence,
and a free pardon for their idol, to many more than
ever popular now that her sex is disclosed. For,
let it be whispered, that this disclosure has operated
in winning over to Gloria de Lara’s side many a
wavering mind, which is able now to recognise in
the brilliant successful life of Hector D’Estrange,
the unanswerable and irrefutable proof of woman’s
power to equal man in all things, provided fair play
and equal opportunities be given to her. Of the
murder of Lord Westray, her adherents believe her to
be absolutely guiltless, and are loud in condemnation
of the verdict.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such is the position of affairs on the morning in
question,—a position sufficiently grave, to warrant the
calling out of the troops to assist the police in maintaining
order, amidst this wholly unparalleled scene
of public protest and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a quiet smile on Lady Manderton’s face
as she answers her friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I came here on foot, Vivi, and I have come to say
good-bye. Ah, Vivi! you need not stare, dear. I’m
not the old Dodo you have been accustomed to. Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>God! why were not my eyes opened before, all the
time that Hector D’Estrange has been working for
us? But it is not too late. I can retrieve the past
even yet, by working on behalf of Gloria de Lara’s
cause. Ay, Vivi, it is a cause well worth dying for.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Dodo, you must be clean gone cracked!
What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Manderton takes a newspaper out of her
pocket, and hands it to Mrs. de Lacy Trevor. “Have
you read this?” she inquires at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. de Lacy Trevor opens it and reads.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Beneath these startling announcements Mrs. de Lacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Trevor further reads much of which she did not know.
Then she lays down the paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, it’s like a dream,” she exclaims. “What
will happen?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What has happened already,” answers Lady
Manderton. “Revolution. Vivi,” she continues
eagerly, “I suppose it’s no use asking you to take
the step I’m going to? I’m going to throw in my
lot with Gloria de Lara, and help her by every means
in my poor power.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dodo! what do you mean?” cries her friend in a
horrified voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean what I have said, Vivi,” answers Lady
Manderton in a quiet, sad voice. “Vivi, I can’t tell
you how terribly I feel my past wasted life. But it
was not all my fault. I was brought up to nothing
better, and probably should never have realised it,
if Hector D’Estrange had not been born. Ah, Vivi!
Gloria’s life has opened my eyes. I see now that
if woman had fair play, women in the position of you
and I, Vivi, would never throw away and waste our
lives as we have done. But, thank God, there is a
chance of remedying it. At any rate, I’ll do my
best. For Gloria de Lara’s noble cause I would die
willingly a thousand times.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She has taken her friend’s hand as she speaks.
“Good-bye, Vivi,” she says gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Vivi has risen and thrown her arms round
Lady Manderton’s neck.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Don’t, don’t, Dodo! You musn’t go! There are
going to be terrible doings; I can see that plainly.
Oh, Dodo! please don’t go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is just a slight curl of contempt upon the
lips of Lady Manderton’s handsome mouth as she
kisses the weak, timid woman, whom all these years
she has been contented to call friend. Then she gently
undoes the tightly clasped hands of Vivi Trevor from
around her neck, and presses her firmly but kindly
back into her seat. “I have no fear, Vivi. There,
now, don’t cry; you will hear of me soon, dear—God
grant better employed than I have been. There now,
think of what I’ve said. Good-bye.” The next
moment she is gone, and Vivi Trevor is left alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a time she sits like one in a dream, then she
rises and walks to the window. The crowd is still
surging to and fro. All traffic is rendered impossible
save on foot. Mounted policemen and military patrol
the street, interfering as little as possible with the
people, who, save for the rougher element already
mentioned, are orderly enough, albeit excited and
angry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What will happen?” mutters Vivi to herself.
“What a strange sight! Never realised before what
a number of people London contains, and what a
strange-looking lot, too! Didn’t think there were
such people in existence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a knock at her boudoir door as she stands
thus soliloquising to herself.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Come in,” she answers.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is Marie, the French maid, and she is the bearer
of a note.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A letter for madame,” she says.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Marie, what a fearful crowd!” exclaims her
mistress. “What will happen? Have you ever seen
anything like it before?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mais jamais, jamais de ma vie, madame,” answers
the Frenchwoman shuddering. “C’est terrible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Marie, you can bring me my coffee and bread-and-butter
now,” continues Vivi, as she turns the note
over in her hand and looks at it curiously. It is from
Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Madame will have to take <i><span lang="fr">café noir</span></i> this morning,”
remarks the maid gloomily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i><span lang="fr">Café noir?</span></i> You know I hate it, Marie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tant pis, madame,” replies the woman, with a
shrug of the shoulders. “But no milkman has called,
and there is no milk in the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we shall starve, Marie!” exclaims her
mistress.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span lang="fr">Je le crois bien, madame,</span>” is all the other replies
as she leaves the room. Marie is not a stranger to
revolution. She was in Paris as a young girl during
the revolt which cost Napoleon III. his throne.
She knows well the suffering which an upheaval of
the people always brings with it. She will be astonished
at nothing that may come. Has she not
been detailing her experiences downstairs to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>frightened servants, who are undergoing <em>their</em> first
hardships in Mr. and Mrs. de Lacy Trevor’s luxurious
service by having to go without milk in their tea
that morning? Do they, by any chance, cast a thought
to the suffering thousands who have no tea into which
to put either milk or sugar,—those suffering thousands
whose condition and very existence has given the brain
of Gloria de Lara many a racking thought, as—when
in power—she has pondered the problem, so far unravelled,
of their amelioration and upraising? Not
a bit of it. These servants do not realise a suffering
which they have never seen. It is just the world’s
way. Not one half of it knows how the other half
lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>Left alone, Vivi Trevor opens her husband’s note.
She thinks it strange he should write to her. He has
never written to her before while staying under the
same roof. She has not set eyes on him since the
day before, when he parted with her after the trial,
conviction, and sentence of Hector D’Estrange. He
had not come in to dinner that night, nothing out
of the way to Vivi, the comings and goings of her
husband being of small importance or interest to her.
These two have drifted more than ever apart since
the days when Mr. Trevor first had his eyes opened
by the Eton boy’s article in the <cite>Free Review</cite>. He has
never sought to interfere with his wife’s goings on,
feeling that to do so would only make his desolate
home more unhomely and comfortless than ever. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>is therefore with some surprise that Vivi reads the
following:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>My Dearest Vivi</span>,—You will wonder at these few
lines, but I feel I owe you some little explanation,
though whether you will care about it I know not.
Our lives as regards one another have not been over
happy; at least I can speak for myself in saying so.
I do not blame you, Vivi, for the want of affection you
have always shown me, or for your goings on with
other men. The fault lies in your bringing up, and
the false position in which your sex is placed by man’s
unnatural laws. I learnt to recognise this long ago,
and to acknowledge the teaching of Hector D’Estrange
as true and just. That noble genius, now unveiled to
a wondering world as Gloria de Lara, is paying the
penalty of her attempt to naturalise woman’s position
in this world, as a lead up to many and much-needed
social reforms. I feel strongly that in this moment
of trial she should receive the support of all men and
women, high and low, rich and poor, who feel with
her, and I have determined to place my services at
her disposal. This, Vivi, will naturally take me away
from you for a time, perhaps for ever. Who knows?
Only God. You will not miss me, for I have never
been anything to you. I do not blame you, dearest,
for I ought never to have married you. Still I loved
you, and love you still; that is my only plea, and I ask
your forgiveness. You will perhaps accord it when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>you realise that I am giving my life to the upraising
of your sex, and to attaining its freedom, thereby
accomplishing the first great step in the direction of
social reform, on which the gaze of Gloria de Lara
is fixed. How this struggle will end I know not. It
will be the greatest revolution this world has ever
known,—far-reaching in its results, and, let us hope
and pray, bringing about a final, fair, and lasting settlement
of that all-momentous question, which has given
to the world its noblest woman in Gloria de Lara.
Good-bye, Vivi.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>She lays the letter down on her lap, and sits staring
at it. Her thoughts fly back across the years of her
wedded life, years spent in vain amusements and false
excitements. She cannot recall a single kindly or
unselfish act on her part towards the man who has
loved her so devotedly and tenderly, nor can she lay
hold of one single act of usefulness upon which she
can look back with either pleasure or satisfaction.
Very acutely she feels this now; and yet has it been
entirely her own fault?</p>

<p class='c008'>“What else could I do?” she murmurs to herself.
“I was never brought up to think of anything else.
Mother bade me marry well and quickly. That’s
exactly what I did do. What other opening was given
me? None. If I had been a man, and properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>educated, I might have done something; but as it
was, what else could I do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her thoughts are flying on ahead now, to that
vague future of which she can know nothing till it
comes. Yet what hope does that glance ahead
bring to Vivi Trevor? Absolutely none. In the
past her life had been wasted, and now the future,
when regarded, brings her nothing but the vague
dread of growing old and <i><span lang="fr">passée</span></i>, with nothing to
turn to when that time comes, nothing to console
her for the gay, giddy life which she has led in
the past.</p>

<p class='c008'>She is beginning to understand Lady Manderton’s
words and action better now. Launcelot Trevor’s note
has opened her eyes very wide. Vivi vividly sees
what she has never seen before, for she is beginning
to think for the first time.</p>

<p class='c008'>She throws herself face downwards on the sofa
upon which she had been reclining so daintily, when
Lady Manderton called in upon her but a short time
since. There is a big black void all round Vivi
Trevor’s heart, a dull, hopeless feeling of despair.
Large tears are welling up into her beautiful eyes,
and bitter sobs shake her slight, girlish frame.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Vivi! She is truly miserable, and yet she
has no idea how to end that misery. In a like position,
Lady Manderton had risen equal to the occasion; but
then the latter is of different stuff to her hitherto gay,
unthinking friend, a woman of stronger brain and sterner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>mould, one who is able to make up her mind, and act
promptly when occasion requires it.</p>

<p class='c008'>There she lies, this victim of neglected childhood
and unfair, unnatural laws. She lies there, a living
protest against the selfishness and conceit that have
built up that wall within which she lies imprisoned.
Of what good is life to such as she, whose education
since childhood has been vain, mindless, ephemeral?
If Vivi Trevor had never been born, the world would
have lost nothing. And yet, as a drop is to an ocean,
so is the life of this one despairing soul to the
thousands who, like her, have gone down to their graves
in uselessness and obscurity, not because in natural
body and mind they were unfitted to work in the
great army of man, not because in desire and willingness
they were found wanting, but because of that
barrier, that artificial mountain which one sex has
forbidden the other sex to climb, which one sex has
erected in the face of Nature, to shut out the operations
of Nature’s laws.</p>

<p class='c008'>These words but reflect the thoughts of thousands,
who, wearily struggling along the path of life, ask
themselves wonderingly, “Why existence, if this is
all it brings?” Many a tired and saddened soul has
lain itself down to die, with the undefined feeling that
the wasted life left behind might not have been if
only—only—ay, if only what? Gloria de Lara, Flora
Desmond, and others, could answer that vague, yearning
cry. They would reply, “If only Nature had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>obeyed.” Therein lies the secret of the troubles of
this world, the suffering, agony, and misery that
millions have to put up with, while a clique lives and
reigns, making laws and leading the multitude by the
nose under the guise of liberty and freedom! For
every happy heart, thousands there are of wretched
ones; for every well-fed mortal, thousands there are
who starve and suffer. The world is old, its years
unknown to the ken of man. Through all these years
man has ruled therein, and this is what he has brought
it to! Can he do nothing better? Yes, but only
hand in hand with woman. Nature declares it; and
he who would fight against Nature, must create the
evils that torture the world.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Downing Street is awake betimes, and within
the precincts of the residence of the First Lord
of the Treasury an unusual stir and signs of an
unwonted anxiety are perceivable. Seated around a
long oblong table in a singularly doleful-looking room,
are a baker’s dozen of gentlemen, apparently in eager
discussion. Perplexity and anxiety is on every face,
not unmixed, in some cases, with vacuity. A stranger
dropped from the clouds, and unaccustomed to the
ways, and manners, and customs of our planet, might
innocently inquire who these disturbed-looking personages
are, and what their business? He would be
told in reply that the personages are nothing more
nor less than the Sovereign of Great Britain’s Ministers,
their business, the holding of a Cabinet Council. But
at such an hour, nine o’clock in the morning! Why,
in the ordinary course of affairs, poor old Lord Muddlehead,
the Secretary of State for the Colonies, would
be adjusting his night-cap, and turning over for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>second sleep in bed, and that excellent nonentity,
Lord Donothing, Lord President of the Council and
Privy Seal, would be sweetly dreaming of rest and
peace, well merited and well earned, after the
arduous and fatiguing duties attaching to his noble
office!</p>

<p class='c008'>However, a matter of importance has shaken sleep
from their eyes, as they have been summoned post-haste
to attend their chief on urgent public business.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chief in question, the first Lord of the Treasury,
the Prime Minister of Great Britain and Ireland, is
the Duke of Devonsmere, a tall, aristocratic-looking
man, with thick moustaches, whiskers, and beard, in
which the grey hairs of advancing age are rapidly
gathering. He has thick lips, a not very pleasant
eye, and a forehead chiefly remarkable for the crease
or wrinkle, which, starting from the centre, runs down
perpendicularly to meet the nose. He has a voice far
from genial; and, in fact, his manner all round is cold,
and haughty, and unwinning.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duke is a good speaker. That is his chief
<i><span lang="fr">forte</span></i>. He has not particularly distinguished himself
through life as a great politician, though he has held
high posts in various Ministries. He has been
Secretary for War in a former Ministry, but seceded
from his chief when this latter brought in his Irish
Home Rule Bill. No one has ever been able to accuse
the Duke of Devonsmere of attempting to aggrandise
himself. In politics he has been strictly honest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>according to his lights, though many believe that in
the old days of Conservatives and Liberals, he would
have graced more appropriately the ranks of the
former, which as a Unionist he eventually joined.
However, those days are past. There are no Liberals,
or Conservatives, or Unionists now. The former having
adopted the Progressist title, the two latter become
merged in the National party, of which party the
Duke of Devonsmere is the head.</p>

<p class='c008'>The position which he holds at this moment is an
awkward one. His is only a provisional Ministry,
held together by the temporary support of the Progressist
party, the natural and avowed enemy of the
Nationals. But the hatred of the Progressists for the
D’Estrangeites is so intense, that for a time their
minor enmity with the Nationals is merged and
forgotten in this new and greater one. It is, therefore,
with such assistance as this, that the duke, with a
Cabinet chiefly distinguished for its dulness and want
of perspicacity, is endeavouring to cope with the
extraordinary state of affairs, that has arisen on the
defeat of Hector D’Estrange’s policy, and the revolution
which has resulted from the events following
upon that defeat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gloria de Lara is at large. Although warrants have
been issued for her arrest as well as that of Lady Flora
Desmond, no traces of either have yet been discovered.
Of course the officials of Scotland Yard surrounded
Montragee House, and demanded admission soon after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the former’s rescue; but when at length the great
front door was thrown open for the admittance of the
officers of the law, they were received only by Lord
Bernard Fontenoy, who smilingly regretted that he
could afford them no information or assist their search
in any way. All he knew was that his brother had
left him in charge of Montragee House during his
unavoidable absence. Clearly there was very little
to be extracted from the youthful lord.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Home Department Minister is speaking now,
but apparently affording but cold comfort to his
colleagues. Mr. Mayhew belongs to the English bar.
He is an excellent speaker, but that is all. It would
have been better if he had stuck to his profession
exclusively, and left politics alone, for he has not
shone in them. He is a weak man, and an obstinate
one, and can never be got to acknowledge having
committed a mistake. He has held office before in a
Conservative Ministry in the same department, which
did not profit much by his supervision, or attain any
particular distinction for efficiency. He is the best
man, however, that the Nationals have at their command
for the post, which is not saying much for the
existing state of things.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Detectives are at work in nearly every great
centre, and the police are fully instructed how to act,”
he assures his colleagues.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you think, Mayhew, that Hector D’Estrange,
or, as I suppose we must now call her, Gloria de Lara,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>has many secret friends in the force? There is no
doubt she has the mass of the working classes of the
country on her side—certainly nearly every woman
amongst them. Depend upon it your detectives will
not trace her, and it seems to me you are all of you
vastly underrating her power.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The speaker is a man of about fifty years of age,
with a fine forehead, rather scant hair, prominent,
intelligent eyes, a sallow complexion, and somewhat
of the middle height. He looks younger than he
really is, and it is probably his long thick moustache
that gives him a little of the military appearance.
But Lord Pandulph Chertsey is no soldier. He is
every inch a politician, living for nothing else but
politics.</p>

<p class='c008'>While we can pass over the remainder of the Devonsmere
Cabinet without notice, because of the extreme
mediocrity of talent displayed therein, a glance at the
character of Lord Pandulph Chertsey is necessary.
The extraordinary point which first strikes one is—why
is not Lord Pandulph Prime Minister? Clearly
amongst all those thirteen gentlemen he is the only
one possessing a large grasp of thought, or a power
to look at events and regard them as they are. Few
men have been more abused than Lord Pandulph; and
yet he has done nothing to merit that abuse beyond
showing a certain independence of mind and an inclination
to follow the dictates of conscience before party.
He has been accused of ambition. It is certain that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>if he had been less honest in his political career, and
less straightforward, he might have risen more
quickly to supreme power. But though doubtless
ambitious—and what sin is there in that?—he has
known how to subordinate his ambition to the dictates
of his conscience in all matters, which, according to
his lights, he believes affect the welfare of Society.
He sees clearly now what the high and dignified
Duke of Devonsmere, old Lord Muddlehead, Lord
Donothing, and their colleagues do not see in the least.
He sees that Gloria de Lara, though she may have
many an enemy in the country, is yet a power which
must not be despised. Lord Pandulph has no sympathy
with her cause or her teachings; but that is no
reason why he should ignore the fact that there are
thousands who have, and who are prepared to support
her. Mr. Mayhew shakes his head. We have said
he is an obstinate man, and obstinacy is more or less
a sign of weakness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no,” he says hastily. “I think it is you,
Chertsey, who overrate her power. Of course she
has a few friends, but not many. I always said
D’Estrangeism was ephemeral. You will see how
quickly the storm she has raised will become subdued.
I have not the slightest doubt on that score. But for
the sake of law and order we must strain every nerve
to arrest both her and Lady Flora. It is a terrible
business, but murder cannot go unpunished, that is
very clear.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Lord Pandulph laughs, as he glances at the duke, who
is sprawling back in his chair with his legs stretched
out. Mr. Mayhew’s remarks appear to him ridiculous.
“Depend upon it,” he exclaims again, “that you are
utterly underrating her power. We know enough
of Hector D’Estrange to be pretty well certain that
Gloria de Lara will not remain inactive. You talk of
your detectives and police, but let me remind you that
there are scattered throughout the country those companies
of Women Volunteers, whom she can call out
at any moment. Surely you do not underrate their
power for mischief?”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mr. Mayhew does, and so do the rest of the
Cabinet, including the Duke of Devonsmere. This
latter is a bitter opponent of Gloria de Lara’s
advocacy for woman’s freedom. He is quite convinced
that the sex is hopelessly inferior to his own, and
regards their emancipation with the same horror
as did the South in the American Civil War when
the North upheld the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think we are straying wide of the mark, Chertsey,”
he observes rather gruffly. “The policy we
have got to decide on, is how the riotous crowds that
are paralysing public freedom are to be suppressed.
There is no doubt that for the moment this adventuress
has a strong party in her favour, but I think,
with Mayhew, that all sympathy with her will quickly
subside, especially if the Government show a bold and
determined front to the mutineers. The most strenuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>efforts must be made to arrest those two women,
and so put an end to the mutiny which they have
provoked. I consider, therefore, that the military
ought to be employed to assist the police, and I
have little doubt that in a very short time order
will be restored. Do you all think with me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The eleven satellites do, but not the independent
planet. Lord Pandulph does not agree, and he says
so plainly. He thinks it will be madness to employ
the military, and thus provoke civil brawls, and perhaps
civil war. He cannot make himself responsible for
such a state of things.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am very sorry,” he says gravely, “but I am
quite unable to fall in with such a policy, which, if
pursued, I believe will entail lamentable results. Do
your best if you think it possible to arrest the leaders
of this movement by means of detectives and police,
but for goodness’ sake keep the soldiers out of the fray.
However, if you persist, I can make way for a fresh
Secretary for India. I can resign.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is an old game with you,” remarks the duke
drily. “It will not be the first time you have left
your colleagues in the lurch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say rather not the first time that I have refused
to stifle conscience for the sake of office, or to make
over my honest opinion to the care of others,” answers
Lord Pandulph somewhat hotly, nettled no doubt by
the duke’s unfair remark. “However,” he continues
quietly, “I have no wish to mar the unanimity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>these proceedings, and will withdraw. My reasons
for resignation can be fully explained in the proper
place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a significant ring in his voice which cannot
be mistaken. The duke knows perfectly well that
with Lord Pandulph out of his Cabinet, this excellent
clique will be little less than a group of mechanical
dolls. To lose Lord Pandulph means discredit to his
Ministry, and a considerable loss of confidence outside
it. He feels he must temporise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Really, Chertsey, I don’t understand what you
want,” he observes impatiently. “A short while ago
you were making fun of the detective force, and assuring
us we had underrated Gloria de Lara’s power.
Now that I propose to take decisive measures to arrest
that power, you object to them. Will you propose a
policy yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I will, as you invite me to do so,” answers
Lord Pandulph, with a smile, “but I do not suppose
you will adopt it. However, here is my opinion. I
am not in sympathy with Gloria de Lara’s desires, but
I fully recognise that her doctrines are accepted by
thousands. I am not likely to forget that it was she
who raised the Hall of Liberty, who drilled into
efficiency a large Woman Volunteer Force, and who
has worked her way into the affections of vast numbers
of the working classes. Having read the evidence at
her trial, I am extremely dissatisfied with the verdict,
while in regard to the death of the policeman in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>prison-van, I do not look upon Lady Flora’s act as
murder. We are assured by members of the police
force, that she fired through the lock of the van, only
after giving the policeman full warning of her intention
to do so. She naturally supposed he had lain
down as she bade him; and though his death is most
grievous, really she cannot be accused of murder.
Looking at matters in this light, I think the wisest
thing the present Government can do is to appeal to
the country to decide the question, revoke the warrant
against Lady Flora, and offer Gloria de Lara a fresh
trial. Such a policy may be out of the way, but we
must not forget that we are now facing a state of
affairs unparalleled in the world’s history. For my
part, I cannot take the responsibility of deciding for
the country. It is the country which should be
appealed to, and allowed to decide for itself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He has spoken as befits a statesman, who is able
and willing to look upon the people as the proper
tribunal to decide the policy to be pursued. But the
Duke of Devonsmere, unlike Lord Pandulph, has
never and will never be able to quit his aristocratic
perch in order to descend to the people’s level. He is
willing to give them a policy and ask them to accept
it, but he cannot realise that the masses are able to
produce one for themselves. It is not wonderful that
he thinks as he does, for he is not, and never has been,
in touch with the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like Mr. Mayhew, he shakes his head.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“Your proposal is simple madness, Chertsey. I,
for one, cannot fall in with it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looks sternly at the eleven satellites who are
regarding him. They thoroughly understand that
look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nor we,” they murmur deferentially, apeing the
abject acquiescence of poor old Lord Muddlehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Lord Pandulph laughs. Words would not
measure the contemptuous ring that there is in that
laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you will pardon me if I say that I think your
proposal madness also. I cannot agree to it, and it
is best I should resign,” he says quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” answers the duke coldly. “As you
are determined, so be it, Chertsey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lord Pandulph rises. He accepts his <i><span lang="fr">congé</span></i> willingly.
It has been gall and wormwood to work with such
colleagues as these. He is out of place, and he feels
it. He knows that he ought to be where the duke
is sitting. Undoubtedly he ought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then it is understood? I shall tender my resignation
without any delay, so that you will be able
to nominate my successor. This being so, it is better
I should retire at once. Good-morning, Devonsmere.”
And without deigning recognition of the eleven
satellites, Lord Pandulph leaves the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Really, Chertsey is about the most insufferable
fellow to deal with I have ever known,” murmurs
Lord Hankney, the Minister for Agriculture, adjusting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>his eyeglass. “We shall do much better without him,
Devonsmere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So they sit on in council these strange twelve, a
Ministry misrepresentative of the people. The policy
against which Lord Pandulph warned them, they
agree to adopt. The military is to be ordered out,
a direct incentive to civil war, while the warrants
for the arrest of Gloria de Lara and Lady Flora
Desmond are to remain in force. It is the old story,
merely history repeating itself, of a group of men
omitting to consult the people—whose paid servants
they are—before acting. Office, unfortunately, nowadays
is too much considered as the happy hunting
ground of a clique or class, to the exclusion of the
people’s acknowledged representatives. So the wrong
men step in, and take upon themselves responsibilities
for which they are totally disqualified and unfitted;
and thus are mistakes committed for which those who
pay the taxes have to suffer. The case in point is
a good one. Such a decision would never have been
come to had the Duke of Devonsmere’s Cabinet contained
some of the people’s representatives.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“What news, Evie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The speaker has risen from a low wooden
stool just outside the verandahed porch of a pretty,
straggling, rambling cottage, hidden amidst many and
various creepers, whose parasitical arms interlace with
each other in bewildering confusion. All around
stretch dark pine woods far as the eye can reach,
as it scans their broad expanse through the cuttings
in the forest, fashioned by the hand of man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gloria de Lara it is, who thus questions the new-comer.
A tall, powerful-looking man, with thick,
bushy beard and whiskers, and a clean-shaven upper
lip. He is dressed in the habiliments of a navvy, and
carries on his back a bag of tools. These he throws
down as he replies,</p>

<p class='c008'>“News, Gloria? Much what I expected. You are
to be hunted down by every means at the command
of Scotland Yard. Warrants are out not only for
your arrest but for Lady Flora’s as well, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>military are to be employed to assist the police in
suppressing the ‘riotous crowds,’ as such are termed
the people who are agitating in your favour. Pandulph
Chertsey has resigned. Bernie was in the House last
night to hear him give his reasons. He says Chertsey
made a splendid speech, in which he advocated an
appeal to the country to settle this question, and a
fresh trial for you. His remarks were received in
gloomy silence by both Progressists and Nationals,
though loudly applauded by the D’Estrangeites. But
the two former have no intention to appeal at present.
They hate you and yours too much, Gloria. They want
to crush you first before they do anything else. To
accomplish this, dog and cat though they be, they
will be amicable in order to attain their end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that,” she answers, with a sad smile; “but
I will do my best to baulk them until my work is
done. Then, they may do as they please.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, Gloria!” exclaims Evie Ravensdale, with
a shudder. “Do not speak of harm befalling you. O
God, forfend it! I could not survive it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She smiles again, still sadly, as she lays her hand
on his arm, and looks at him with the dark sapphire
eyes that have haunted him day and night for many
a year with a strange, yearning love, which he often
found hard to fathom. He understands it all now,
however. There is no mystery about that love any
longer. Its cause, Gloria de Lara.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is I who should say hush, Evie dear,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>says gently, “and it is you who must not speak thus.
Remember the great cause we have both at heart, the
glorious cause that must and shall win! On its
behalf are we not ready to face trial and trouble,
and many an anxious hour? Ah, Evie! remember
our vows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, he remembers them well enough. Is he not
striving to fulfil them even now? But the future,
threatening, as it does, the person of all that he holds
most dear, is dark and fearsome in Evie Ravensdale’s
anxious mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you manage to see Flora Desmond?” she
inquires, breaking thus the silence which has followed
her last words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Gloria,” he answers; “and that reminds me
that I have much to tell you. Lady Flora has not
been idle. She is indeed a most wonderful woman.
There she is working away in the heart of London,
with the warrant for her arrest duly out, with detectives
and police in every direction, and yet not an
idea have they where she is, thanks to the people’s
loyalty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“God bless them!” is all Gloria says. She is
eagerly awaiting the information he has to give
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is not working single-handed either. Who
do you think has joined the White Guards, Gloria?
You will never guess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who?” she says anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“Why, Lady Manderton! and Launcelot Trevor
has offered his services to Lady Flora.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lady Manderton!” Gloria can hardly believe her
ears. She looks incredulously at the speaker.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is true, Gloria, however impossible it may seem;
and a real enthusiastic worker she is. However, to
business. Lady Flora told me to tell you, that she
has sent picked messengers from the White Guards
to every one of our Volunteer centres, so as to be able
to keep up active communication with them all. The
code adopted works admirably, and has been arranged
with extreme skill and forethought. In a few days
all will be ready for your campaign. She suggests
that you should hold a first meeting in the Hall of
Liberty. The White Guards will be in readiness for
that one. If the police and military interfere every
means for escape will be at hand. Before they have
time to look round you will be heard of at York,
where you will be attended by the Women’s Rifle
Corps, and so on. Rapidity of action will be the
characteristic feature of your campaign—a regular
Will-o’-the-wisp crusade, in fact. Of course it will
be attended by a good deal of risk; but it is quite
certain that the people must be appealed to, and those
who are supporting you now not left in the lurch.
God grant there may be no more blood shed!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, God grant it indeed!” she answers fervently.
“Nevertheless, Evie, ’twere better thus to shed one’s
blood than to submit any longer and without protest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>to the present state of things. Whatever may be the
outcome of this revolution, I have no fear but that it
will lead up to victory in the future. I may never
see the day. What matter? <em>It will come.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughs softly, a low triumphant laugh, as her
mind’s eye strives to pierce the murky darkness of
the future. Instinctively she realises what lies behind
that impenetrable veil, and sees with the glance of
prophecy the promised land beyond. It is thus with
all reformers. If to them was only vouchsafed the
cold, sneering support which the world generally
bestows upon early effort, they would sink and die
beneath the venomed shafts of the unbelievers; but
these latter do not see the noble visions which are
given to the pioneers of the future, visions which
beckon them forward, and unfold to their eager gaze
the triumph of their labours in the establishment of
that for which they have given their lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I will go and get rid of this disguise,”
observes the duke, with a smile. “This beard and
these whiskers are uncommonly hot, Gloria. By-the-bye,
when does Mrs. de Lara sail?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In two days, Evie, she goes by the White Star
Line,” answers his companion. “I left her in the
study just before meeting you. Go in and see her
before you change.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He passes on through the porch, outside of which
he had found her sitting on his arrival, and enters the
cottage, and Gloria takes up her old position to ponder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>and think over the situation of affairs, which her
trusty messenger has brought to her from the outside
world.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have not seen her since that eventful evening,
when she was rescued by Flora Desmond and her
White Guards from the arm of the law, and safely
escorted to Montragee House. Here a hasty consultation
had been held, and it was at once decided that
without delay she must quit the duke’s mansion.
Within an hour of her entrance she had left the ducal
residence, and in a suit of plain dark clothes had
sought a safe asylum with humble friends, in a quarter
of the city where no one dreamed of searching for
her. The duke himself had quitted his home to
avoid awkward questions, leaving it in the care of
his brother, and Mrs. de Lara had repaired to her
Windsor residence. Communication had been maintained
through loyal and trustworthy friends, and
from her refuge in the mighty city, Gloria had rejoined
her mother and the duke at “The Hut,” a tiny out-of-the-way
residence belonging to the latter, situated in
the heart of the pine forests that clothe the country
for miles around, between Bracknell and Wokingham.
From this secluded nook she could hold communication
with her friends through the medium of Evie
Ravensdale, who in various disguises passed to and
fro between Bracknell and London daily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile the Devonsmere Ministry has been
active. Supported by the Nationals and Progressists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>a Bill has been hastily passed through the House of
Commons, and sent up to the House of Lords for
approval. It grants the Government exceptional
facilities for suppressing the public meetings, which
may be held by Gloria de Lara’s supporters. A large
number of special constables have been enrolled, and
entrusted with extensive powers. The military have
been ordered to hold themselves in readiness to
support the police, and a special proclamation has
been issued, offering a large reward for the delivery
up to justice of the persons of Gloria de Lara and
Flora Desmond, or any man or woman found actively
espousing the former’s cause. Armed with these
tremendous powers, the Devonsmere Ministry are confident
that the revolution will be summarily suppressed,
and the chief actors brought speedily to justice. In
vain Lord Pandulph Chertsey has warned them
against the course they have resolved upon. He is
unheeded, for the Ministry have a majority in their
favour in both Houses, and are determined to enforce
their policy rigidly and unrelentingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this Gloria de Lara knows full well. The situation
is thoroughly understood by her, and the risk
fully appreciated, but she knows also that she will be
faithful to her vow. She is of the same mind now
as she was when, as a child, looking over the lovely
Adriatic, that feeling had entered her heart which had
bidden her go forward and struggle for the cause,
even though the struggle should end in death. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>made a vow then; through all these years she has
kept it. Now that danger and death stare her in the
face, will she draw back appalled? No, ten thousand
times no.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her plans are fully formed, and none so fit as
Gloria to carry them into effect. In every part of the
kingdom she has faithful emissaries at work. Aided
by them, large open-air meetings are to be convened,
which she will address in turn, vanishing as quickly
and mysteriously as she appears. In this way she
will be able to hold communication with the people
in every part of the country, and scatter broadcast the
seeds of her great doctrine. She knows full well that
aid and sympathy will come to her from all parts of
the world. She is sending messengers in every direction,
Mrs. de Lara having volunteered to visit America
on behalf of her child’s cause. She knows that the
flame once kindled, will never more be extinguished,
until victory waves aloft the wand of peace. If in the
struggle she be doomed to fall—what matter, so that
the great cause triumph?</p>

<p class='c008'>She has the law against her, but law is only strong
so long as the people acknowledge it to be just, and
agree to obey it. No law is binding or sacred which
has not been ratified by the people’s approval. There
is no natural Divine right which gives to a few men
the power and authority to impose on millions a
command to obey. Might alone can force it. It has
been declared that might is right. What if the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>defy might, and struggle against its tyranny for the
triumph of right?</p>

<p class='c008'>She sits on alone, revolving this truth in her mind.
Thought absorbs her with its dreamy influence, carrying
her on beyond the present into the great unfathomed
future before her. She sees the storm
which she has raised angry and defiant, the elements
thereof tossed and buffeted, but she knows that after
that storm the waves of fury will be stilled in a great
calm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dreaming, Gloria? Of what, pray?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She starts. The voice thrills her, for she loves it
well. Gloria’s contact with the world in her self-imposed
duties has not blunted or dulled the instincts
of Nature. In past days, it was a favourite remark
with our grandmothers and grandfathers, that woman’s
connection with the coarser things of life would
degrade her by constant familiarity with them. Poor
things! They judged of Nature from the narrow-minded
platforms on which they had been educated,
knew nothing of and cared nothing for the sighs of
liberty, or the rights of Nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes! though her life has been one of constant intercourse
with man, though she has been and is familiar
with the coarser things of life, Gloria loves, and loves
truly and well. Hers is not the love of a timid,
ignorant girl, longing to escape the captivity in which
she has been reared, or the selfish, guilty love of the
<em>intriguante</em>, whose love would fade and disappear were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>it not deemed unholy. Hers is the love of one who,
knowing the world well, understanding the character
of man, drilled to a knowledge of the laws of Nature,
yet elects to love one being above all others. Gloria’s
love is one that once given, can never die.</p>

<p class='c008'>As with her, so it is with Evie Ravensdale. The
world has courted his love, but its wiles have not
awoke it. Often, when in loving commune with his
friend Hector D’Estrange, the thought would flash
through the young duke’s mind, that if Hector had
been a woman, the great love of which he felt himself
capable, would have gone out to her absolutely and
without reserve. What was the subtle power that
had attracted him to Hector D’Estrange, which had
made him pause on the verge of pleasure’s precipice,
and, casting to the winds his hitherto selfish existence,
had made him body and soul the devoted adherent of
the young reformer?</p>

<p class='c008'>Evie Ravensdale knows the reason now. From the
moment that he learnt that in Hector D’Estrange was
embodied the person of Gloria de Lara, he understood
that the influence of a noble, high-minded, and genuine
woman, had allured him from the false glare and
glitter of the world, and had given him an aim in life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, dear Evie! have I not much to think of?
In such times as these, thought does not take much
rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She rises as she speaks, and links her arm in his.
Men have often watched Hector D’Estrange and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Duke of Ravensdale in this friendly attitude before.
Such an ape is Fashion, that it has become the <em>proper
thing</em> for men to walk arm-in-arm. Doubtless, however,
in view of the change which has come about in
the altered fortunes of Hector D’Estrange, it will be
suddenly discovered that such an attitude is both
unbecoming and improper. So much for the monkey
Custom and its cousin ape Fashion!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us go for a stroll, Gloria,” he pleads, “the
evening is so glorious; and it may be long before we
have the chance again of a quiet chat together. We
used to enjoy those <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-têtes</span></i> at Montragee when you
were Hector D’Estrange, did we not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she says quietly. “I did love them, Evie.
In fact, I think I set too great a store upon them,
more than was good for me to do; but they were a
true rest and pleasure after toil and anxiety, and I
accepted them as such.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They have descended a gentle slope as she speaks
and entered a glade in the forest. The warm, red
glow of the setting sun pierces in parts the thickly
grouped pines, and plays upon the ferns and bracken
that grow in green luxuriance beneath. The evening
commune of the birds is dying into a low twitter, and
the rabbits have commenced to peep forth from their
burrows to see if all is still, preparatory to indulging
in the evening meal, as is their wont and custom at
this hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is it that throws its shadow across the glade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>in the wake of Evie Ravensdale and Gloria de Lara?
As the two saunter slowly along the forest’s green
pathway, the figure of a man suddenly presents itself
at the entrance to the glade, and stands motionless
gazing after the retreating pair. Only for a moment
though, as with a low laugh he turns quickly in the
direction of “The Hut.” His movements are peculiar.
He does not walk openly up to the cottage, but, concealing
himself behind the rhododendron bushes
which surround it in thick luxuriance, he stealthily
and silently gains the porch, outside of which Gloria
de Lara was sitting on the arrival of Evie Ravensdale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Passing noiselessly along the verandah which runs
round “The Hut,” the man suddenly comes to a halt
outside a half-opened window, and peers in. A logwood
fire burns cheerily on the hearth, but there are
no lamps as yet in the room, and this is the only
light that irradiates it. It is sufficient, however, to
enable him to make out the form of a woman seated
by the fire. Her elbows are resting on her knees, and
her head is bent in her hands, and through the half-opened
fingers she is gazing into the glowing blaze.
A single ring flashes on the third finger of her left
hand; one ring only, but no more. The man’s eyes
dilate with passion and fury as they watch her. The
expression is that of a wild beast gloating upon its
prey. This man, too, has a smile of triumph upon his
coarse, sensual lips, mingled with malignity and hate.</p>

<p class='c008'>A quick shudder runs through Speranza de Lara—for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>this lonely woman is no other than she—as with
a sudden impulse she raises her head and looks towards
the window with a scared and startled expression.
The man draws quickly back from his post of observation,
and passing rapidly along the verandah disappears
amidst the thick bushes already mentioned. Too
late, however, to conceal his features from the gaze
of the woman, who, alas! knows them too well. With
a cry of horror she springs forward, and pushing open
the window makes her way out on to the verandah.
Two minutes later, and the tongue of a little tower
bell rings out half-a-dozen sharp, warning notes.
Evie Ravensdale and Gloria de Lara know full well
their meaning. Their sound heralds the word
“danger,” and brings them sharply to attention.
When, a few minutes later, they reach “The Hut,”
they find Speranza anxiously awaiting them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Evie and Gloria,” she says in a quiet, self-possessed
voice, in which all trace of excitement is
absent, “this is no longer a safe place for either of
you. It must be quitted at once. I have just seen
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Him! Who, mother dearest?” inquires Gloria
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The worst enemy I have ever known, and therefore
yours too,” my darling, answers Speranza, with
a shudder. “Ever right, my child, were you when
you said he was not dead, for I have just looked on
the face of Lord Westray.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>As she speaks the distant sound of a galloping horse
strikes upon their ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Evie,” says Gloria coolly, a quiet smile lighting
up her face, “will you see to the horses being saddled
at once?”</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The roar of London’s traffic has died away, for
a few brief hours, peace has spread her mystic
wings o’er the city of wealth and poverty, pleasure
and suffering, joy and pain, virtue and crime. In the
sumptuous dwellings of the wealthy, the gentry stretch
their pampered bodies on the soft couch of ease and
warmth, imitated to a nicety by their dependents. In
the dwellings of the middle class, comfort if not
absolute sumptuousness is displayed and enjoyed. In
the dwellings of the working class, overcrowding and
limited space is the chief characteristic, while in the
dwellings of the helpless, homeless, and foodless, the
vault of heaven is their canopy, the cold flag-stones
their couch of rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet above these scenes, so diversified and strange,
peace for a few brief hours has spread her wings.
The tramp of the tired horse is silent, the patter of
millions of feet is still. Even the wandering, homeless,
hungry cur is curled up in some byway fast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>asleep, dreaming, no doubt, of the rich steaks of meat
upon which his poor famished eyes had been fixed this
afternoon, when the cruel butcher drove him so mercilessly
away.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there is a faint glimmer of light stealing
through the fast-closed shutters of Mr. Trackem’s
private room, in Verdegrease Crescent, and if, like
the fairy of old, we obtain ingress therein in some
mysterious manner, we shall find that worthy seated
in a comfortable armchair, with his head thrown back
against a soft cushion, his legs crossed, his elbows
firmly planted on the chair’s arms, and his hands
lightly joined together. A warm fire glows in front
of him, and the smile on his face betokens a thorough
satisfaction with things in general, and especially with
himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the opposite side of the hearthrug is another
armchair, likewise occupied, but by a man apparently
in by no means so placid and contented a frame of
mind as Mr. Trackem. He wears a rough coat and
waistcoat of Cheviot wool, and his cord riding breeches
and black top-boots are covered with mud and mire.
There is blood on his spurs too, which betokens a hard
usage of the poor beast that has lately carried him.
On the floor lies a brown slouch hat and riding-whip,
while by their side is a soft satin cushion, similar to the
one against which Mr. Trackem’s head is reclining, and
which his visitor has disdainfully tossed on one side.</p>

<p class='c008'>The manner of this man is excited, and he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>leaning forward, and speaking fast and rapidly. He
is a handsome man, but has not a nice face, and
grey hairs are beginning to mingle in his thick beard,
whiskers, and moustache, as well as amidst the once
raven locks of his hair. He has thick sensual lips,
two rows of fine white teeth, and a restless, roving
expression in his dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you, Trackem, I have seen them all three,
and I greatly fear that Mrs. de Lara recognised me.
Maybe she did not, for the moment she looked round
I made off as hard as I could, and have ridden straight
from the spot to this place. But if she did, there will
be great danger of our plot being discovered, and the
idea to me is simply maddening after all I have done,
and risked, and put up with to carry it successfully to
an issue.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Trackem refuses, however, to get excited.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pray listen, my lord,” he says suavely. “I think
it is extremely unlikely that Mrs. de Lara recognised
you. But even if she did, of what avail? She cannot
prove it, and her statement would only be regarded
in the light of falsehood, invented to screen Gloria
de Lara, or else in the light of hallucination. We
managed that point very well at the trial. No, no;
have no fear on that score. The only point to be
looked at is this. If Mrs. de Lara recognised you, or
even took alarm at seeing a stranger in her child’s
place of refuge, she, and those with her, have in all
probability sought a fresh hiding-place. If this be so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>their arrest will have to be postponed, until we can
lay hands on the spot of their new asylum. It is a
pity, for my efforts appeared to be on the verge of
crowning success. However, cheer up, my lord.
Trackem has never yet failed in any of his jobs, and
will not in this one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was a fool to act as I did!” exclaims Lord
Westray, for it is no other than he; “but I could not
resist the impulse, Trackem. How do you propose to
act if to-morrow we find the birds have flown?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I propose this, my lord,” answers Mr. Trackem
in a decided voice. “I intend to send round information
to Scotland Yard of their whereabouts. Should
this information prove too late, I propose to proceed
in this wise. I have in my employ a young woman
of extremely prepossessing appearance, and without
doubt the cutest of all my staff. She has never failed
me yet, and I am not apprehensive that she will on
this occasion. My instructions to her will be to ascertain
Gloria de Lara’s whereabouts, to join her in this
rebellion—to be, in fact, one of her most devoted
adherents, until such time as I shall require her to be
otherwise. When she has been thoroughly entrusted
with the rebel secrets, nothing will be easier than to
transmit them to us; in fact, I think you know what
I mean, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand,” mutters the other moodily. “You
mean to set her to the informer’s trade. A female
Judas, in fact.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“You have it, my lord, extremely well expressed.
Ha, ha!” laughs Mr. Trackem quietly, as he rubs his
hands together, and nods approvingly. “And what
does your lordship think of my little plan?” he
continues inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Damned clever and diabolical, Trackem, if you
want to know the truth,” answers Lord Westray a
shade bitterly. He has fallen pretty low, but this
seems indeed the lowest depth of the abyss into which
he is invited to plunge, for the being who is an accessory
before the fact is every whit as villainous as the
being performing the deed. Of course he knows
this.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Clever, I grant you, my lord. It is my business
to be so. Diabolical I demur to. All is fair in love
and war. But pardon me, excuse a moment’s absence,”
and Mr. Trackem, as if struck by a sudden idea, rises
and leaves the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lord Westray rises, too, and begins pacing up and
down it. There is a dark, angry look in his eyes, and
a cruel smile on his thick lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All fair in love and war,” he exclaims savagely;
“that is a true saying. I loved her—yes, I did love
Speranza once, but she scorned and flouted me, and I
could not forget that. Even after I married her I
loved her, I believe, though she complained that
I treated her cruelly. And what if I did? She was
only a woman, and my wife. What business had she
to complain? What business had she to take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>law into her own hands, and go off with that fellow?
Ah! I think she counted without her host there,
but I was revenged,—yes, yes, I took ample revenge.
And then, when she might have made it up, when
I offered to re-marry her, she flung me from her
path, and that girl of hers, whom I thought then
was a man, ordered me out of the house. Ah! but
I think there again I have come off the victor. I
think it is I who have scored. The world believes me
dead; Hector D’Estrange, now Gloria de Lara, is my
murderer. If we lay hands on her, the Government
is bound to make her pay the full penalty of the law.
It will break Speranza’s heart, and I, I shall triumph
and be revenged. None shall flout or scorn <em>me</em> without
rueing it. By God! no one ever shall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The laugh is a horrid one with which these last
words are accompanied. It is hard to believe the
man a human being. Character of this description
is false to Nature, surely? Yes, but the education
which produced it was false and unnatural too.
Human character depends greatly on early teaching.
The parent has a heavy responsibility in the moulding
of youth’s first impressions. Lady Westray, if from
the grave you could arise and look upon your handiwork,
perhaps even you, shallow, vain, heartless as
you were in life, might shudder and repent!</p>

<p class='c008'>At this stage the door opens, readmitting Mr.
Trackem. He walks over to his seat by the fire and
reoccupies it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“I have sent for her, my lord,” he informs Lord
Westray in a business-like voice. “It has struck
me that it will be best to employ my female Judas
without any delay. Second thoughts convince me
that it would be mere waste of time to communicate
with Scotland Yard. I have not the smallest doubt
that, as Mrs. de Lara caught sight of you, ‘The Hut’ is
vacated ere this. At any rate, we will put Léonie on
the track, and start her from there. I have no fear
that she will disappoint us. She has a marvellous
genius for the discovery of the hidden.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A human bloodhound and Judas combined in
one,” laughs Lord Westray. “I am curious, Trackem,
to behold this monstrosity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A curiosity which is about to be gratified,”
remarks the other coolly, as a low tap is heard on
the door of the room in which these two men are
hatching their diabolical plans. “Come in, Léonie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The door opens softly, and a woman glides in. She
is small and of slight build, with a bright, fair complexion,
even, firm mouth, dark grey eyes fringed
round with a wealth of lashes, which at once attract
the onlooker by their extraordinary thickness. Her
hair, which is cut short, is soft, glossy, and wavy, and
is parted on one side, clustering upon her forehead
and around her face. On this face play the lights
and shades of a constantly changing expression, and
if ever genius told its tale in eyes, it is indelibly
stamped in these.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Mr. Trackem smiles covertly as he glances at Lord
Westray, and notices the expression of surprise in
this latter’s face. Léonie has walked straight over
to Mr. Trackem’s chair, and is standing beside
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You want me?” she inquires in a matter-of-fact
voice. Apparently the break of dawn summons is
not in the least strange to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do, Léonie,” answers her master quickly. “I
have a little job on hand that I think I can entrust
to you, and I rely upon you to carry it out successfully.
There is, as you no doubt know, a large reward offered
for the apprehension of the adventuress Gloria de
Lara, or for such information as may lead to that
apprehension. Now I see no reason why my clever
little Léonie should not be the person to win that
reward, or at any rate a part of it. My commission
to you is this. First of all get speech with this
Gloria. This necessitates finding her out. Next,
worm yourself into her confidence by a display of zeal
which I can perfectly trust you to simulate. Keep
me informed of her plans and movements as soon as
you are able to speak with certainty of them, and be
ready to act as I bid you on receipt of any communication
or instruction which I may desire to send you.
Now, Léonie, remember I trust this job to you,
because there is none so fitted as you to undertake it.
I have every faith in your sagacity and prudence. I
have heard a good deal of Gloria de Lara’s wonderful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>cleverness; I am mistaken if my little Léonie is not
her match.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a glitter in the girl’s dark grey eyes, a
quiet smile on her lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may trust me,” she remarks laconically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know I can,” answers Mr. Trackem gravely;
“I know that very well. Now, Léonie, your work
begins at once. Gloria de Lara, her mother Speranza
de Lara, and the Duke of Ravensdale were seen at a
little place called ‘The Hut,’ near Bracknell, belonging
to the duke. I have reason to think, however, that
they have fled that place this very night. You had
better go straight there, and take up the scent from
the spot. I leave all to you. You can draw upon
me, you know. Keep me advised of your whereabouts,
stick to the letter of my instructions, and send me
good news as quickly as possible. I have no more
to say, unless it be that you are to effect that which
Scotland Yard cannot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” answers this strange laconic creature, as
with a slight inclination she turns and leaves the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m blowed, Trackem, if that is not the
queerest elf I ever set eyes upon in my life!” exclaims
Lord Westray as the door closes. “Where on earth
did you raise her from?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A pretty elf, too, eh, my lord? Hardly a monstrosity,”
observes Mr. Trackem drily. “Where did I
raise her from, you ask? Well, that’s just the point.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>I don’t care to tell you who she is, but I’ll tell you
this much. She’s the daughter of a customer of past
days. Her father was a great man. At least the
world said he was. She’s got plenty of blue blood in
her veins; she’s well bred enough. Her mother died
here. The great man forsook her, and the child was
left in my hands. I found her pretty, remarkably
intelligent, and quick-witted. I determined to train
her to be useful, and I think I have succeeded. She
has certainly proved a most profitable speculation, and
repaid the excellent education I have given her. I
have no reason to repent my philanthropic act,” and
Mr. Trackem laughs drily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you are a clever fellow, and no mistake,
Trackem. I gave you credit for a good deal, but not
for rearing detectives from childhood. I thought I
knew pretty nearly everything, but this is a new
experience,” remarks the earl, fairly surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my lord, you have seen a good deal and know
a good deal. I admit your experience is wide and
varied. But not even you know half that goes on
in this wonderful city. There’s many a queer thing
takes place about which outsiders know nothing. It’s
only natural. What else can you expect in a place
like this? And now I think I have no more to communicate
for the moment. It will be daylight soon,
and I feel I want a snatch of sleep. I will bid you
good-night therefore; and I don’t suppose you will be
sorry to follow my example. You have had a pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>long, tiring, and eventful day. Good-night, my
lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Saying which, Mr. Trackem rises from his armchair,
takes hold of a small hand-lamp standing on a table
close by, and with an obsequious bow to the patron,
for the sake of whose gold he is serving, leaves the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>For yet another hour that patron paces up and down
it, absorbed in moody thought. It is hard to draw
the picture of this man, when one thinks how otherwise
it might have been had the passions of his youth
been curbed, his early life disciplined, and his powers
for good fostered and encouraged. If the dream of
Gloria de Lara be realised, the time will come when
character such as this will know an existence no
longer; but this can only be when the standard of
morality is placed on a higher pedestal, and the laws
of Nature are acknowledged and upheld.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Quitting the presence of Mr. Trackem and Lord
Westray, Léonie has hurried to her bedroom,
from which the former personage had so unceremoniously
summoned her. The bedroom in question is
small and plainly furnished. A scant, square piece
of carpet covers the middle of the floor. There are
two chairs in the room, a tiny iron bedstead, a washhand-stand,
and a large wardrobe. This latter article
takes up an ungenerous share of the space which the
little room affords, but it is evidently an article of
some importance, for Léonie goes straight to it and
throws it open, displaying to view some half-a-dozen
shelves, upon which a number of suits of clothes of
varied and multifarious shapes, are neatly arranged.</p>

<p class='c008'>After scrutinising them for a few minutes Léonie
selects a strong dark-coloured pair of riding breeches,
gaiters to match, and a loose jacket and waistcoat of
the same material, which she lays on the bed. To
these are quickly added a grey flannel shirt and a
complete silk under riding suit. She then proceeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>with her toilet, and when dressed looks every inch a
comely lad of some seventeen summers, smart, neat,
and natty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her next act is to pack a small saddle portmanteau
with a change of underclothing, toilet and washing
articles, which completes the outfit of Mr. Trackem’s
youthful detective; for Léonie, though a slave, is not
unmindful of her personal appearance. She knows
she is pretty, and likes to look so, a vanity for which
the looking-glass is largely responsible. A small oil
lamp burns fitfully in one corner of the room. She
fills a tiny kettle with water, and placing it on a
miniature stand, sets it to heat above the flame. Then
she makes her bed, and tidies up her room with
business-like alacrity, and as the kettle begins to
hiss, she takes from the chimney-piece a cup and
saucer, a small tin of preserved coffee and milk, and
a spoon. In a few minutes this Bohemian girl has
mixed herself a steaming cupful of the beverage, and
abstracting a couple of biscuits from a small paper
parcel also on the chimney-piece, proceeds to enjoy
her somewhat camp-like meal.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she wastes no time over it. Léonie is essentially
a business-like person. She has settled in her
mind the exact hour at which she must set out, and
she knows she has not many minutes to spare.</p>

<p class='c008'>In effect, grey dawn is beginning to streak the
murky sky with light. She can hear a distant tower
clock chiming the hour of five, and she sets down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>her cup on a chair close by and takes up the little
portmanteau. “Time I started,” she mutters to herself,
as she cons in her mind Mr. Trackem’s instructions.
Léonie is a most perfectly disciplined young lady;
she has thoroughly learnt the lesson of obedience. It
has never entered her head to disregard or evade her
master’s commands. Mr. Trackem has certainly
succeeded in teaching her to take a pride in her
work, and in training her to a faithful discharge of
duty. He has reason to congratulate himself, and to
boast that this girl slave has never failed him yet.</p>

<p class='c008'>She passes along the passage leading to the staircase,
and descends this latter noiselessly. All is silent
throughout the house as she lets herself out of the
front door and closes it softly behind her. Then she
sets off at a smart walk along the Crescent, and gaining
a side street turns down it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The street in question is more or less a mews, but
as yet there are very few signs of life within it.
Léonie, however, seems quite at home in this place,
for she walks down it unhesitatingly, until at length
she comes to a halt opposite a stable door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Drawing a key from her pocket she unlocks this
door and lets herself in. There are some half-a-dozen
horses tied up in an equal number of stalls, and they
greet her with neighs and a good deal of grunting and
stamping about. A rough shaggy-looking dog, with
the coat and body of a stag-hound, and the head and
drooping ears of a bloodhound, rises from a bed of hay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>in the corner of the stable, and comes up to her with
wagging tail and a doggy smile on his rough and
shaggy face. She pats him kindly. “Come on,
Nero,” she says at the same time; “I shall want you.”
Then she goes to the corn bin and measures into the
sieve a feed of oats, which she takes over to a bay
horse at the far end of the stable. This produces a
loud protest from the remaining five animals, which
to any one acquainted with horse language is unmistakable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps there is a kind corner in Léonie’s heart.
Maybe it is only to secure quiet. Who knows? But
she fills up the sieve brimful once more, and divides
the oats amongst the five protesting animals. At any
rate, it gives them contentment for a while, judging by
the crunching and munching that goes on.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little harness-room adjoins the stable, and Léonie
dives into this, and unearths a neat light man’s saddle
with grey girths and a pair of bright small steels.
The saddle is quickly girthed on to the bay horse, and
then a plain double snaffle is produced from the same
quarter to be slipped in the animal’s mouth directly
he has finished his meal. Léonie is anxious to be off
before the stable men come in, which will be about
six o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Consulting her watch, she sees it is nigh on half-past
five. As the clock chimes that hour the girl
leads the horse out into the mews, followed by Nero.
Closing the stable door and locking it, she turns to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>steed, and gathering the reins in her left hand puts
her foot in the stirrup, and swings herself lightly on to
his back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, Nero,” she calls again to the dog as she
puts her horse into a trot and leaves the mews behind
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her course is taken for Waterloo Station. None
whose gaze fall upon her as she rides through the
awakening streets, followed by her shaggy companion,
would take her for what she is, a female detective in
the employ of Mr. Trackem. But then a well-got-up
detective ought to be unrecognisable, and Léonie, the
handsome, gentlemanly youth to all appearance, <em>is</em>
well got up.</p>

<p class='c008'>On reaching Waterloo, Léonie sees to the boxing
of her horse and dog. She elects, too, to travel with
them in the horse-box as far as Bracknell, which place
is reached at nine o’clock. Here the horse-box is run
into a siding.</p>

<p class='c008'>Léonie loses no time, for she knows that every
moment is precious. She sees to the unboxing of the
horse, and before remounting him slips a shilling into
the porter’s hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How far is ‘The Hut’ from here?” she inquires
as she does so.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, the Duke of Ravensdale’s Hut, sir? Oh,
nigh on two miles. But there’s no one there, sir.
It’s shut up; there’s only the forrester and his wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just, the persons I want to see. You mean of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>course——, there now, the name has quite slipped
me,” exclaimed Léonie, with well-feigned appearance
of annoyance at the name having just that moment
escaped her memory.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Miles Gripper, old Miles Gripper and his
wife, sir,” puts in the porter, eager to supply the
young gentleman’s defective memory. “They are
well known to the country round, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, of course; how stupid of me to forget!”
answers Léonie briskly. “Well, now, my man, just
tell me how I must frame for ‘The Hut.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just cross that there bridge, sir,” explains the
porter, pointing upwards, “and bear away down to
the right. Keep straight on that road, sir, till you
can’t go no further; there you’ll see a road going left
and right. Take the right turn, sir, and after that the
next right turn what ever is, and then stick to that
road, and never mind any turns that you see, until you
come to two cross-roads, the left one with a signboard
directing to Aldershot. Don’t you go taking
either of those two turns, sir, but ride on another
fifty yards, and you’ll see a small wooden gate on the
left. That leads to ‘The Hut’. It’s away in the
forest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, my man,” says Léonie politely. “I
think I understand. I go up over that, bridge, bear to
the right, keep straight on till I must turn right or
left, then take the right turn, and the very next that
is, ride straight on until I reach the cross-roads, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>about fifty yards further, where a gate on the left
leads up to ‘The Hut.’ Is that it?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Exact, sir. You couldn’t have it more exact,
sir. If you follow those directions you can’t mistake,”
answers the porter glibly. The shilling and
the young gentleman’s whole appearance has impressed
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, good-morning, my man, and many thanks,”
says Léonie, as she begins to move her horse away.
She is surprised when the next moment the porter
comes up alongside her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Beg pardon, sir, no offence, sir, but be you a
friend of the duke?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Léonie is perplexed, but she answers evasively,
“What do you want to know that for, my man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because,” answers the honest fellow with an eager
look in his eyes, “because, sir, I’ve been reading all
about how the Government is a-hunting of him and
that great man Mr. Hector D’Estrange. Least they
say Mr. D’Estrange is a woman. I don’t know, and
I don’t care. I don’t see what it matters whether
Mr. D’Estrange is a man or a woman, sir. He’s the
people’s friend, sir; he wants to help us poor folk.
There is no humbug about him, sir, and we love him
for that, we do. If you know them, can you tell me
if they are safe, sir? Forgive a poor fellow asking
this, sir—but oh! I’d die for them, I would, sir!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The blood rushes to Léonie’s face. What is it that
brings it there? Perhaps a vague, undefined feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>of shame that she should be bent on an errand so
degrading with the true words of the honest working
man ringing in her ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, they are safe,” she says hurriedly. “Here,
take this, my man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She throws him another shilling, and as he stoops
to pick it up, she puts her horse into a quick trot, and
widens the distance between herself and her interlocutor.
What does Léonie know of goodness, gratitude,
or any high and noble virtue? In that young,
cold, calculating heart of hers, what room is there for
devotion or love? She wonders, as she rides along,
why that man’s words brought that flush to her face,
and what that strange feeling was that made her
heart beat and her pulse throb. She puts it down to a
fear that her object and mission might be recognised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m getting nervous, I believe,” she laughs to
herself. “That will never do. Mr. Trackem has
always told me to be cool and self-possessed. What a
fool I was to let that man see he had flustered me!
Léonie, you are an idiot!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She tightens her horse’s rein, and just touches
him lightly with her heels as she speaks, and the
animal breaks into a canter. Nero gallops happily
by her side. The dog is enjoying his outing in the
country. Two miles at this pace is quickly got over,
but Léonie draws rein as she reaches the cross-roads.
To the left stands a signboard, and “Aldershot” is
written on it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“Fifty yards further on,” mutters the girl as she
trots forward. The porter’s directions are very exact;
the wooden gate is before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She rides through it, and enters a narrow carriage
drive, closed in on both sides by tall pine-trees. Thick
rhododendron bushes fill up a few open spaces here
and there. The little road is steep and precipitous,
leading sharply upwards. Léonie throws the reins
on her horse’s neck and gives him his head. She has
no fear that her four-footed friend will stumble. Horse
and rider know each other well.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly, however, she picks up the reins and urges
him forward. A sudden thought has struck Léonie.
She must not be caught napping. The time has come
to employ her detective wiles, and she acts on the
impulse that has seized her. Such a pace up such
an incline is naturally trying to her steed. Thus,
when rounding a sharp turn in the forest road she
comes into full view of ‘The Hut,’ her animal’s sides
are heaving pretty freely, and he is decidedly blowing.</p>

<p class='c008'>She brings him up to the little front entrance at
the same pace, and reins him up abruptly. In another
moment she has pealed the bell.</p>

<p class='c008'>She can hear a slight scuttling inside, and voices
whispering, which causes a delay not at all in keeping
with her plans, so she peals the bell again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then steps come rapidly forward, and an elderly
man in a dark green cord suit and brass buttons opens
the door.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“I have a message for the Duke of Ravensdale,”
exclaims Léonie in a low, confidential voice. “You
are Miles Gripper, are you not? Ask his Grace if
I can see him. It is of the utmost importance, admitting
of no delay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miles Gripper scratches his silver head and looks
perplexed. He is a faithful servant and an honest
one. His instructions have keen most specific. He
has been told to feign absolute ignorance of the
duke’s movements or whereabouts, though he knows
them well. But Léonie’s words have staggered him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gracious!” he ejaculates. “But his Grace is
not here, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not here!” gasps Léonie, with well-feigned dismay.
“Good God! what is to be done?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is his Grace in danger?” blurts out the forrester
tremulously. “Oh, sir! what is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Danger!” echoes Léonie. “I should just think
so. Look here, my man, I have come post-haste
from London to see him. He must be warned, or
both he and Gloria de Lara will be in custody before
the day is down. Can I trust you to take his Grace
a message? I was told you were a faithful and
trustworthy servant of his.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miles Gripper is completely taken in. His honest
heart bounds with loyalty at Léonie’s words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, sir! and that’s just true. His Grace has no
one more devoted than old Miles Gripper. I’d give
my life for his Grace, I would. But, God forgive me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>how can I take your message, sir, in time? He’s far
from here by now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What! far from here?” again gasps Léonie; “but
not out of riding distance, surely? Tell me where
he is, and, tired as my horse is, I’ll do all that is
in human power to reach him. God grant I may
not be too late!”</p>

<p class='c008'>What does Léonie know of God? Still less does
she care about Him. God, to Léonie, is an expression,
a forcible expression, and no more. The expression
serves her well on this occasion, however. Miles
Gripper’s honest heart is no match for detective acting.
Believing that he is serving the duke, he passes the
secret, which he was bidden to keep, into the care
of this apparently devoted and self-sacrificing adherent
of his master.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And drat ye for a big-headed fool, when his Grace
express forbade ye say aught of his whereabouts save
to the Lady Flora,” Léonie hears a sharp, angry
woman’s voice exclaiming. But she waits to hear
no more. She is on her horse, and trotting quickly
down the hill with the secret she had been puzzling
her brains how to win, safe in her keeping. Small
wonder at Dame Gripper’s ire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, Nero, laddie,” laughs the girl detective.
“I thought I should want you, doggie, but I can do
without you now. However, come along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She rides back to the cross-roads and the signboard.
On one of this latter’s arms is printed “Marlow.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“That’s it,” she mutters to herself, as she turns her
horse’s head into the long straight road, which, girt
on either side by tall dark trees, stretches far as the
eye can reach. “I’m safe on the track now, I am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Léonie is happy. One of the most difficult obstacles
in her path has been lightly cleared, and quite unexpectedly
too. Yes, she is happy, if it be possible for
one so hard and callous to be so. Perhaps the dawn
of a better day is coming for this child of an unholy
love. As she rides along in the bright spring morning
however, with her rough dog galloping by her side,
she has no higher aim in life than to carry out successfully
the “little job” which Mr. Trackem has confided
to her care.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>It is the last day of summer, and the evening hour
is creeping on apace. A truly glorious day it has
been, warmed by a brilliant sun, the heat of which
has been tempered by one of those gentle zephyrs that
love to play where all is warmth and sunshine.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now the day is dying, fading, as it were, gradually
away. Time, which the science of man can never
stay, stalks slowly on his path. It is he who declares
that the spell of life which has lit the day with its
brilliance, must pass onward into the darkness of
advancing night.</p>

<p class='c008'>For what is life but a greater day of warmth and
sunshine, storm and rain? What is death but the
night which brings rest after the toils or pleasures of
that day? What is the future life beyond, but a
new day breaking into existence, perchance in a world
more lovely than our own?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>So thinks Gloria de Lara as she leans on her oars
and watches the dying glories of this fading day
vanish beneath the waves of the western sea. The
zephyr which has played so joyously amidst the light
and sunshine of earlier hours, has fled to his couch of
rest, and now not a breath stirs the glassy waters
of Glenuig Bay, which, lit by the radiance of the
setting sun, blazes all around like a lake of molten
gold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Above its gleaming waters and those of Loch Eilort
tower heather-girt mountains in their mantles of
purple and of blue. Higher still above these well-clad
slopes the grey stone of shaggy crags looks down,
and higher yet above these lonely scenes the golden
eagle hovers, secure from the destroying hand of
man. Not altogether lonely though, if one may judge
from a pale, thin line of smoke that suddenly curls
upwards through the still air from one of those high
grey crags. It catches the eye of Gloria de Lara as
she leans upon her oars, and sends a flush of surprise
to her thoughtful, dreaming face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So soon!” she exclaims, and there is a ring of
wonder in her tone; but she settles herself to her oars,
and sends the boat along with quick, powerful strokes.
She has pointed its head for the open sea, straight, in
fact, for the channel that joins the heaving swell of
the grey Atlantic with the placid waters of Loch
Eilort.</p>

<p class='c008'>Months have passed away since we were last in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Gloria de Lara’s company. We left her when the
spring of the early year was just budding into life,
we rejoin her now on the eve of spring’s destroyer’s
advent—autumn.</p>

<p class='c008'>How has it fared through these months of light
and sunshine with this woman and her cause? A
retrospect will show.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have seen how Léonie, on reaching ‘The Hut,’
had found it vacated, and had ridden on in the direction
of Great Marlow. Truth indeed, she took the same
route over which Gloria, Speranza, and Evie Ravensdale
had ridden the night before. No sooner had it
been decided to quit ‘The Hut,’ than Gloria had despatched
Rita Vernon to London, to apprise Flora
Desmond of the change, and then she and her two
companions had ridden on in the darkness of night
towards Great Marlow. On reaching the outskirts of
the town, the three had turned down a narrow lane
leading in the direction of Bisham Abbey woods,
and Gloria, with a confidence which familiarity with
a place always engenders, had led the way. Finally,
the lane had opened into green fields with a line of
bridle gates leading through them, and these she had
carefully followed for a time. At length, however,
Gloria had borne away from the beaten track, and
directed her horse’s head towards a long strip or belt
of trees, at the further end of which stood a solitary
cottage with a large barn behind it, and some compactly
built dog-kennels in the rear. In one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>windows of this lonely dwelling a solitary light was
burning, a light which told the fugitive in silent words
of the faithful watch that was being kept.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now this was the cottage of the head keeper of the
Bisham Abbey estate, both of whose daughters were
troopers in the White Guards’ Regiment. The entire
family was loyal to Gloria de Lara’s cause, and this
cottage was one amidst many a dwelling of the people
where Gloria knew she had only to knock to gain
admittance, only to show herself to obtain a loyal
greeting and hospitable and secure shelter from tracking
foes. The organisation which had thus contrived
to spread a network of secret and devoted friends
throughout the length and breadth of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was surely no
mean and contemptible one, and spoke volumes for
the constructive and administrative capacity of Gloria
de Lara and Flora Desmond. In every county this
network had its headquarters in the Volunteer centres,
with which communication was actively kept up by
means of a code peculiar to this organisation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Against these forces of a people’s love the Government
had brought to bear the forces of the law. All
that money and power could procure were at this
Government’s command. And yet the difficulty of
working had become pretty soon apparent, amidst a
people whose lips refused to tell, and whose eyes
became blinded by a sudden cloud whenever information
was sought or demanded. In order to guard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>against the importation of informers into the Volunteer
ranks, Flora Desmond had issued an order to the
effect that no more aspirants were to be enrolled, an
order which greatly hampered and took by surprise
the forces of Scotland Yard, which had counted on
informers’ assistance to a large degree in obtaining
information.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was at the cottage, therefore, of staunch, true, old
Joe Webster, that Gloria had sought her first refuge
amongst the people, after her flight from the metropolis.
It was from the same cottage that Speranza
had bidden her child farewell before setting out on
her voyage to the United States, as an accredited
delegate to plead the D’Estrangeite cause. It was at
this cottage that Flora Desmond had secretly held
council with her chief, and had arranged the details
of the first public meeting at which Gloria was to
appear. And it was at old Joe Webster’s cottage, too,
that Léonie, in pursuit of the <i><span lang="fr">rôle</span></i> which Mr. Trackem
had set her to play, had presented herself before
Gloria, and representing herself as one who had left
home and interests to serve the great cause, had
implored Gloria de Lara not to refuse her services,
but to let her work for her even in the most menial
capacity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bright, earnest face of the girl, her dark eyes
glowing with genius, her pleading voice and apparent
enthusiasm, had struck home to Gloria de Lara’s heart,
the noble nature of which could not suspect treachery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>to lurk beneath such evident devotion. Léonie’s
prayer had been heard by the woman who trusted her,
and on whose betrayal and destruction she was bent.
The first great meeting had been one of unlimited
success for the D’Estrangeite cause, and therefore of
proportionate discomfiture and humiliation for the
Government. In the crowded Hall of Liberty, the
D’Estrangeite members had assembled to protest
against the assumption by the Nationals of the conduct
of affairs without first making an appeal to the
country, and also to call for a free pardon for Flora
Desmond, and a fresh trial for Gloria de Lara.
Government reporters had attended and taken voluminous
notes of the speeches, policemen and detectives
had assembled in full force by command of Mr.
Mayhew, and established a strict watch. Proceedings,
in fact, were in full swing, and it only needed the
presence of one being on whom the thoughts of all
were centred in that vast throng, to complete the
assembly. Suddenly, upon the lowest of the six
circular galleries that surrounded the dome of the
hall, two forms were seen to appear. No need in
pointing them out to inquire who they were. The low
cheer which greeted their first appearance, soon swelled
into a roar of wild, tumultuous applause and welcome,
which flooded the vast building with deafening strain,
and told of the enthusiasm and love that awoke it.
What other being but Gloria de Lara could have commanded
such an ovation? Truth it was she and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>trusty companion Flora Desmond, who stood before
them, habited in the uniform of the White Guards’
Regiment, in which the people knew them both so
well.</p>

<p class='c008'>In full view of the crowded House, in full view of
the D’Estrangeite members, in full view of Government
reporters, and Mr. Mayhew’s police and detective
forces, Gloria had addressed the vast throng. Spellbound
the people had listened to her words of hope,
of encouragement, and of cheer. And when, in conclusion,
she had bidden them fight on for the right,
and actively resist wrong, the cheers had rung out
again and again with deafening roar. Yet even as
those cheers began to die away and the people’s eyes
turn lovingly once more to their great leader, Gloria
and her companion had vanished.</p>

<p class='c008'>And what had Mr. Mayhew’s police been about?
Why had they not arrested these daring two? How
possible? The only means by which the galleries
above could be reached, was through some twenty iron
doors below. Yet when the police sought an entry,
they found these doors securely barred by an invisible
hand from within.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course a cordon of constables had been quickly
drawn around the building, and detectives had watched
anxiously day and night. Futile! as it soon became
evident, when news reached the Government a few
days later that Gloria de Lara had addressed a meeting
in the north of England, that the police and troops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>hastily summoned had attempted to arrest her, but
that, securely guarded by the Women’s Border Light
Horse Volunteers, she had managed to effect an escape,
and no trace of her whereabouts had up till then been
obtained. Energetic authorities, however, took care
to cap this unwelcome intelligence with the information
that the police were prosecuting an unremitting search!
<i><span lang="it">Cui bono?</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>Meeting upon meeting had followed; concourse
after concourse had assembled. Simultaneously they
would be heard of in the north, south, east, and west
of England, of Scotland, or of Ireland. No public
placards or advertisements announced these meetings,
and yet they were always well attended. It seemed
as though some secret, mysteriously silent fiery cross
passed through the districts in which they were held.
But the authorities could not say for certain; they
could only surmise. Machinery was at work beneath
the surface which they had no power to fathom. The
speakers at these meetings were manifold and various.
The D’Estrangeite members were particularly active,
but after Gloria de Lara and Flora Desmond, the
people’s favourites were undoubtedly the Duke of
Ravensdale, Nigel Estcourt, Lady Manderton, Launcelot
Trevor, Archie Douglasdale, and Jack Delamere!
Wonder of wonders! What! Colonel Delamere?
The swagger Guardsman, the spoilt child of Society,
the man whose life had hitherto been one long succession
of amusement and pleasure? Is it possible?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Quite so. There is no impossibility when Nature steps
in to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c008'>What influence has been at work thus to change
the current of Jack Delamere’s pleasant but useless
existence? What has induced him to take up the
cudgels for Gloria de Lara’s cause? Ay, what?</p>

<p class='c008'>Ever since that evening when, in obedience to orders,
Jack Delamere had charged the crowd which barred
the way between his Blues and the White Guards,
ever since that day when he had marked the heroism
of those men and women that composed it, ever
since he had seen them go down before the horses of
his troopers, sacrificing their lives so that their idol’s
might be spared, Jack Delamere had been a faithful
and devoted adherent of the D’Estrangeite cause.
Perhaps, too, his love for Flora Desmond may have
influenced him. Who knows? The influence of a
noble and high-souled woman is surely the greatest
incentive a man can have to do right.</p>

<p class='c008'>Money, too, had poured in from all quarters of the
globe, and from all manners and classes of people.
The women, who in the palmy days of Hector
D’Estrange had responded to his appeal on behalf
of the Hall of Liberty, had not been laggard when
the author of its being had again called upon them
for sympathy and aid. The sinews of war had flowed
in rapidly, and none had commanded it more quickly
than Speranza de Lara.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such a state of things had of course become intolerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>to the Devonsmere Ministry, which in the early
days of the movement had so confidently predicted
its speedy collapse, as well as the arrest of Gloria de
Lara and Flora Desmond. Every effort to capture
these two had, however, proved unavailing, protected
as they had been by a people’s love.</p>

<p class='c008'>A people’s love! It was a noble gift to have won,
a treasure of which they might well be proud, one
which they might surely pray ever to deserve. None
knew better than Gloria de Lara and Flora Desmond,
that without it their fates must long since have been
a prison’s cell and a felon’s doom.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the eyes of this Government matters had become
desperate. The efforts of the police had been paralysed.
Conflicts had taken place between the military and the
Women’s Volunteer Regiments, and strong measures
appeared necessary to check the disorders. Gloria de
Lara’s enemies had pointed to the Volunteer organisation
as the root of the mischief, and it had been
resolved to destroy it. Parliament had been asked
to grant exceptional powers to meet this dangerous
combination. Parliament had acquiesced, and forthwith
a proclamation had been issued declaring the
Women’s Volunteer organisation to be illegal, and
decreeing the instant disbandment of its regiments.
The exceptional powers had furthermore empowered
the police to arrest and imprison without trial all
women who should be seen wearing the uniform of
these regiments; and it had likewise been decreed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>felony to shelter or harbour the persons of Gloria de
Lara or Lady Flora Desmond, or to take part in any
public meeting in which they should participate.</p>

<p class='c008'>This Coercion Act, the first which had ever been
passed for Great Britain and Ireland combined, had
rendered the position of Gloria de Lara and Flora
Desmond one of extreme peril, while threatening
the liberties of thousands of their countrymen. A
secret meeting had been called, the situation discussed,
and it had been agreed that for the sake of the cause
thus threatened these two must leave the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>But how? That was the question. Every port
and sea-going vessel was strictly watched. In this
dilemma Archie Douglasdale had submitted a plan.</p>

<p class='c008'>This plan was that his sister and Gloria de Lara,
together with Nigel Estcourt and himself, should retire
to one of his properties on the shores of Glenuig Bay,
where amidst its shaggy woods nestled a little fishing
box, remote from the haunts of man. In this lonely
retreat, guarded by trusty Ruglen retainers, he had
declared his belief that for a time they could rest
concealed, while Evie Ravensdale, repairing to London,
should from there direct the immediate fitting-out
of his yacht, in which, so soon as ready, he should
put to sea, and work round to the Sound of Arisaig,
where the fugitives could be embarked. And this
plan had been approved of and acted upon. Gloria
de Lara, Flora Desmond, Nigel Estcourt, and Archie
Douglasdale had taken up their quarters in this safe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>retreat, and Evie Ravensdale had repaired to London.
With him had gone Léonie, who had been commissioned
to bear back the duke’s instructions when all
was ready. It was a fatal arrangement this last;
but Léonie had played her part well, and had won
the confidence of all. Thus it is that we find Gloria
de Lara on the last dying day of summer, amidst the
scenes described at the opening of this chapter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Léonie has arrived from London. She has been
instructed, she declares, to inform Gloria de Lara that
the duke’s yacht <em>Eilean</em> will proceed to sea and cruise
about in the neighbourhood of Muck Island, so as
to avoid the steamer track. The duke himself will
make Glenuig Bay in a fishing smack, embarking
every one thereon the day after his arrival. This
arrival is timed for to-day, and Evie Ravensdale
has sent a private message by Léonie asking Gloria
to meet the smack at its entrance to the bay. At
least so says Léonie, and Gloria believes her. She
has sent the former to the top of a high crag to watch
for the advent of the smack, with instructions to light
a warning fire on sighting it. We have seen the
pale blue line arise, and now Gloria, with quick, rapid
strokes, is pulling for the bay’s entrance. Her heart
is happy, for is not Evie Ravensdale at hand? She
never dreams of treachery.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boat flies through the water, which parts with
hissing sound on either side of the bow’s keel. Now
the splash and upheaving of the craft tells the rower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>that she has left the bay and entered the open sea.
She casts a glance ahead, and sees the smack bearing
down towards her, and then she sees the sail lowered
and the vessel hove to. Once more she plies her
oars, for she has caught sight of a tall figure waving
to her, and making signs to bring the boat alongside
the smack.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ship oars!” she hears a voice exclaiming as she
nears it, and she obeys with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In another moment a sailor has seized the painter,
and two others have sprung into the boat. She looks
up expecting to see the face of Evie Ravensdale. One
glance, and she knows that she is betrayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Up with the sails! Starboard the helm! Put
the boat about, and fetch yon lad off the rocks,” is the
quick command she hears given as the sailors heave
her aloft on to the deck, and two other men push her
into the cabin below. Then the hatch is battened
down. There is a coarse laugh. Once more has
Léonie won.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“There is the smoke, Estcourt; Ravensdale must
be in sight,” exclaims Flora Desmond, as she
leans on her empty rifle and scans the peaceful scene
far away below.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So soon?” inquires the young man looking up.
“We must have strangely miscalculated the time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there’s the smoke right enough, Estcourt;
and Léonie is far too smart to make a mistake. However,
no need to hurry; it is such a glorious evening,
and the last for me on these dear old hills, perhaps
for ever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She says the last words sadly, and there is a yearning
look in her fine eyes as they rove the familiar
glens and corries, rugged crags and purple stretches
which she and Archie Douglasdale learnt to know by
heart in childhood, in their happy hunting excursions
together long ago. Far away below, Loch Eilort and
Glenuig Bay shimmer in the setting sun, whose light
is gleaming across the grey waters of the open sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>These two have been away all day after deer, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Archie Douglasdale is still absent on the same quest.
They have not seen him since they parted with him
on the Black Crags some seven hours ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lord Estcourt rises and comes to her side. He
is a tall, well-made man, with expressive features,
and a pair of grey eyes which Society has declared
to be magnificent. Plenty of women therein have
been willing to fall in love with Nigel Estcourt;
no end of scheming and would-be mothers-in-law
have instructed their daughters in the virtues, wealth,
and charming characteristics of that very nice young
fellow, and charged the poor things to exert their
utmost to win him. But Nigel Estcourt has never
yet been seen to pay court to any woman, and Fashion
marvels thereat. But since he was a boy of seventeen
he has held love’s secret next his heart. It was at
Ruglen Manor, long ago, when, as a mere lad, he first
saw Flora Ruglen, that Nigel Estcourt first opened
the book of love. It was to him that she, his first
girl friend, had opened her heart, and it was to her
that his boyish soul had responded. Born with a
golden spoon in his mouth, with all that the world
most covets, it was but natural that Fashion should
court him. But Nigel Estcourt was not responsive
to its adulation, and snubbed it most unmercifully.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Flora Ruglen had married Sir Reginald
Desmond, young Nigel had sorely grieved; but his
friendship for her had not abated, for he loved her just
the same. He was still only a boy, of course, and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>one would have seriously predicted that this, his first
love, would be his last.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other men had loved Flora Desmond, and love her
still. She has had no lack of offers since poor Reggie
Desmond died. Over and over again has smart Jack
Delamere pressed his suit. He has never loved any
woman like he does her, but he presses his suit in vain;
for gently, kindly but firmly, Flora Desmond has told
him that she will never marry again. She had told
Estcourt the same thing when for the first time, now
three years ago, he had confessed his love and asked her
to marry him. She had told him then that he must
put that love from him for ever, for the reply which
she then gave him would remain unchanged. Yet,
with tears in her lovely eyes, Flora had told him also
how deeply she valued his friendship, how grateful
and honoured she felt by his love, and how she prayed
that the strong, firm bond which had held them
together so long, since as boy and girl they had first
made friends, would endure through life. Perhaps if
one thing had not happened, Flora Desmond might
have returned young Estcourt’s love. Perhaps if the
wand of fate had not decreed otherwise, her heart
might have gone out to him. It seemed almost
natural that she should love him, he who had
received her earliest confidences and been her first
friend. But one thing had intervened to make this
impossible. Flora Desmond loved another.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some women can love much and often, some can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>almost adore, and then forget. To Flora this was
impossible. Hers was a heart which could not lightly
love, which, slow to appreciate, would nevertheless,
when once unlocked, love truly, faithfully, and well.
And thus it had been with this woman so seemingly
love free. For years ago that feeling had flooded
her heart, had taken possession of her, never to pass
away, when as Lady Flora Desmond, but a year
after her marriage, she had seen Evie Ravensdale
for the first time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Who shall describe or fathom the depth of a true
and pure love? None have been able to do so yet,
none ever will. Flora’s love was such as asked for no
return, content only to be allowed to love.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet, who knows that there may not have shot,
now and again, through Flora’s heart when, after the
death of Reginald Desmond, she and Evie Ravensdale
were thrown often into each other’s company, a
gleam of hope that her love might in time come to be
returned? It may have been so; but if so, it vanished
finally and for ever when the personality of
Hector D’Estrange was revealed in Gloria de Lara.
Unmistakably on that evening when she had rescued
this latter from the prison-van and had handed her
into Evie Ravensdale’s safe keeping at Montragee
House, Flora Desmond had read in the dark and
beautiful eyes of the young duke the secret of his
heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>It never entered her mind to cavil at his choice or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>to resent it. No pang of jealousy had shot through
her heart against the woman to whom his love had
been clearly given. Only, when she had read his
secret, had the feeling rushed over her that the love
which she had nursed and cherished for so long, was
imperishable and impossible of recall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not that she wished or sought to recall it. Flora
would have sooner died than part with the first true
love of her life; it was to her a treasure that she prized
beyond expression, priceless to her in value. He lays
his right hand on her shoulder for a moment as he
stands by her side, and she feels it tremble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a day I shall never forget, Flora,” he says
gently; “I have been very happy. It will be something
for your old friend to look back upon, when
you are far away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean Estcourt?” she inquires
hastily. “But you are coming with us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he answers decisively. “I have other work
to do. I shall never rest till I have obtained for you
the pardon that will extricate you from this outlawed
life. I can be of use to you by remaining, I have
some influence still in high quarters, and I could do
you no good by going to America. Of course I should
like to go; you know, Flora, I am never so happy as
when I am with you, but I don’t mean to think of
<em>Ego</em> on this occasion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The tears rise to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall miss you, Estcourt, dear old Estcourt,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>she says softly; and then her hand steals into his,
and he feels the grateful pressure in its firm touch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The blood rushes to the young man’s face, for that
touch thrills him through and through, though the
ring in her voice tells him that affection, and affection
only, not love, is there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll never miss me as I shall you,” he answers
passionately. “Ah, Flora! you don’t know the dull,
blank void that comes over me when you are not by;
you don’t understand the lonely feeling that masters
me, the yearning to see your dear face again. Of
course, Flora, you cannot understand what I suffer,
for I don’t believe you know what love means. I
have often heard you called ‘the cold Lady Flora.’
I begin to believe you are rightly named.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is her turn to flush now, but she turns her head
away that he may not see the hot blood in her cheeks.
Evie Ravensdale’s face is before her in imagination.
She sees the dear, dark, dreamy eyes, the clear-cut
features, the beautiful forehead around which the raven
curls are clustering; she sees him as plainly as
though he stood before her, for is not his presence
burnt into her mind with the exactitude of reality?
She loves him with all her heart, and power, and
soul, and mind. No sacrifice for his sake would
seem hard. To die that he might live would be a
joy. If Flora Desmond does not know what love
means, then who does?</p>

<p class='c008'>But Estcourt can only judge by what he sees. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>knows she has rejected the love of many men. There
is no one, save himself, to whom she appears to give
a preference, and has she not told him that she can
never marry him? Is he not justified in his conclusions,
therefore? Perhaps so. Few men have ever
been able to read a woman right.</p>

<p class='c008'>She pulls herself together, however, and turns his
remark off with a jest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cold am I, Estcourt? An iceberg, probably! I
almost think so, too, for it’s actually beginning to
feel chilly up here. How blood-red the sun has
turned. Mark my words; we are in for a storm this
evening, and I doubt any embarkation being possible
to-morrow. I know these old shores well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you are chilly, Flora,” he says almost bitterly,
“we had better make haste down the Crag Vale.
It would not do for you to catch cold.” Her evident
desire to turn the conversation has not escaped him.
It hurts him, and he shows it.</p>

<p class='c008'>She marks the bitter tone of his voice. Flora
knows Estcourt so well. A woman can generally
read a man pretty correctly if she chooses to; of a
certainty if the man loves her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She faces him suddenly with the glow of the blood-red
sun lighting up her handsome face. She is earnest
in what she is going to say, and she looks it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Estcourt, dear old Estcourt, let there be no misunderstanding
between us two, and on the eve of
parting. This may be the last opportunity of telling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>you what I wish to. Don’t gibe me as cold and
heartless, for it is not true, not true. Do I not know
how chivalrously and devotedly you have loved me,
and am I not grateful to you for your noble and
generous love? Why should I ask the question,
because you know it? You know I would not speak
untruly, and I tell you that your love is very precious
to me, and I value your great friendship more than
anybody else’s in this world. Were you not my first
friend? Am I likely to forget that? But, Estcourt,
dear old man, you must not throw your love away on
me, for I shall never marry again. I shall always
look on you as my first, best, and truest friend, and
love you dearly, very dearly as such, but I can never
marry again—no, Estcourt, never!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nor I,” he answers quietly, with a sad smile.
“You are hardly the woman to bid a man marry
where he does not love. Flora, I have loved you
ever since I first saw you; I shall never love any one
else but you. At least you will do me the justice
to believe that I am as unalterable as you are. Let
us never bring this subject up again. Let it bide by
the Crag Vale Cairn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He kisses her hand tenderly and respectfully, and
then he lets it fall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go down now, Flora dear,” he says gently.
“I wonder why Ravensdale’s smack has not turned
the point yet. It ought to be round by now if Léonie
were right.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“I’ll back her to be right,” answers Flora, with a
slight laugh. “She’s not likely to mislead Gloria,
who, by-the-bye, I saw turning the point in her
coracle quite ten minutes ago. They’ll be round in
a second, I daresay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two scramble down the rough face of the
mountain side in silence. The thoughts of both are
busy. Suddenly, however, Estcourt brings himself
to a halt and calls out to Flora, who is a little ahead
of him,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Flora! who can that be?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her eyes follow the direction in which his hand
points, and she sees a four-oared boat coming out of
Loch Eilort into the Sound of Arisaig at a rapid pace,
and heading for Glenuig Bay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must be Archie,” she calls back. “I suppose
he got to the far end of the lake, and has come back
by water. The boat is Bruce Ruglen’s, and the oarsmen
are his four sons. I know it and them well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He comes running down to where she is standing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Flora dear,” he says quickly, “use your eyes.
The man in the stern is not Douglasdale. It’s Evie,
as I live! What can Léonie have meant, and why
does not Gloria come back? Surely there cannot
have been treachery? My God! surely not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Flora never stops to surmise. Her face is
deadly pale, and she has turned at his words, and
is hurrying with fleet steps down the mountain side,
with Estcourt following quickly in the rear. Fast,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>faster she goes. Flora Desmond is as nimble as a
deer. No monstrous, tied-back petticoats encumber
her. She is habited in the neat, graceful kilt in the
tartan of her brother’s clan and her own, which suits
to perfection her supple, well-made form. In it she
is free to use the physical powers which Nature has
given her, and which she has never sought to stunt
or to curtail.</p>

<p class='c008'>She makes straight for the shore, and as she moves
along she loads her rifle. Then as she reaches the
water’s edge she fires it off.</p>

<p class='c008'>This attracts the inmates of the boat. They look
her way, and perceive that she is signalling to them
to come in shore. In a moment Evie Ravensdale has
turned the boat’s nose in her direction, and she sees
that he is urging the oarsmen to exert their utmost.</p>

<p class='c008'>The men endeavour to obey; they bend their backs,
and send the boat hissing through the still waters.
Foam flakelets fly before the racing keel propelled by
irresistible force, and yet to Flora Desmond it appears
to come but slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Back water, men!” she shouts, as the boat nears
the shore. “Don’t beach her. I want to push her
off and jump in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Estcourt is beside her now, and they are both up
to their knees in the water. The men are resting
on their oars as the boat glides slowly forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Flora and Estcourt have it by the prow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Estcourt, push off!” exclaims the former,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>as bending chest downwards she arrests its course.
The edge of her kilt in front sinks into the water, in
another moment her knee is on the boat’s edge, and
she is standing in the bow with her companion by her
side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Evie!” she exclaims, in a low excited voice,
“how is it you have come this way? Is anything
wrong? We expected you in a smack, and Gloria has
gone to meet you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A smack!” gasps the young duke. “What do
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>But she does not answer him. She has turned, and
is addressing the four clansmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ruglens,” she says quickly, “pull to the point
for your lives! Pull men, pull; pull with the strength
God gave you. God in heaven, pull!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They answer to her appeal, do these young giants.
Do they not know her well? Is she not a Ruglen?
Are they not Ruglens too? Have they not as children
played with their young chief and his sister, joined
in their rambles, mingled with their sports? Well
do these Highland laddies understand her quick command,
understand it and obey. She has crossed to the
stern, where the duke sits staring mutely at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give me the helm, Evie,” she says quietly. “I
can steer the shortest cut. Don’t look like that, Evie;
it may be all a mistake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But her voice tells him she does not think so.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boat tears through the water; the clansmen are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>doing their best. There is not a word spoken. Only
the splash of the oars, the dull thud of the twisting
rowlocks, the hiss of the boat’s keel, break the
stillness of Glenuig’s Bay.</p>

<p class='c008'>They have reached the point now. Four more
gallant strokes from the men whose brows are thickly
studded with the bead drops of extraordinary toil, and
the boat rises on the first rolling swell of the open
sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>The smack is there; it catches the straining eyes of
Evie Ravensdale, as he springs up and gazes across
the great grey ocean waste. To her dying day Flora
will never forget the terrible groan of agony which
bursts from him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ay, the smack is there, but they come too late.
The brown sail is spread, it is already far away,
vanishing into the creeping, dull, dark veil of the
advancing night and rising storm.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“All shall come right, everything shall be explained;
you shall have immediate liberty, if,
on behalf of your mother, you will promise me what I
ask. I know perfectly well she will do it if <em>you</em> ask
her. Now will you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The speaker is a middle-aged man, with deep, dark
eyes, handsome features, and bold, resolute carriage.
Grey hairs peep here and there from out his thick
beard, moustache, and whiskers, and there are grey
hairs in his once raven hair. He is dressed in a navy-blue
serge suit, and wears the buttons of the royal
yacht squadron.</p>

<p class='c008'>To all appearance the person he is addressing is
a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four
summers. He is tall, and slight, with a face of extreme
beauty. He has rich gold-auburn hair, and his eyes
are deep blue in colour. Nothing will compare with
them but the sapphire.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wears a well-fitting shepherd’s plaid kilt, stockings
to match, and silver mounted brogues. A loose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>white flannel shirt and waistcoat and jacket complete
his attire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will not,” is the stern, cold reply which he gives
to the speaker’s query.</p>

<p class='c008'>This latter grinds his teeth, but checks the rising
anger within him, and speaks once more in a persuasive,
almost pleading voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think again. Consider all that depends on your
decision. After all, my request is perfectly honourable.
I simply ask that she shall consent to re-marry me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Great God! and you call that an honourable
request, Lord Westray? You think it a simple
matter, that my mother should wed again my father’s
murderer? I tell you a death of hideous torture
would be more preferable to me, than that a fate so
awful should befall her. Cease, I pray you, this
subject. I have but one answer to your hateful proposal,
and that is, no!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you weighed well in your mind the fate
that awaits you, Hector D’Estrange, if you persist in
this refusal?” asks Lord Westray threateningly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name is Gloria de Lara, my lord, not Hector
D’Estrange, as I think you know full well. The fate
that awaits me I fully realise. I am condemned to
death for a murder never committed; I am to die that
your vile vengeance on my beloved mother may be
fully wreaked. Do your worst. I do not fear death;
and my mother will bear the blow as bravely and as
nobly as she has borne others.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>She folds her arms proudly, and there is a world of
scorn in her beautiful eyes as she fixes them on the
cowardly brute before her. A wild gust of wind
shrieks angrily above board as the smack rises and
plunges in the trough of a choppy sea. The blood-red
sun has vanished, an inky darkness has set in, and the
wind is rapidly increasing from a fresh breeze into a
regular fierce and nasty gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lord Westray staggers, and almost reels up against
her as the smack lurches forward on the crest of a
more than usually excitable wave. There is a rush of
feet on deck, and men’s voices are heard shouting
above the noisy wind. She starts back from him in
horror; she would not touch him for the world. His
very presence in the close, stuffy little cabin seems to
stifle her. Gladly would she seek an asylum in the
ocean’s angry waves, and trust to Fate to enable her
to reach the shore, or die.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cabin door opens, and the skipper peers in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Beg pardon, sir,” he says, touching his oil-skin
cap, “but I must put to sea, sir, I must. We’re in
for a regular duster. I daren’t coast no longer, sir.
It’s pitch black, and the shore for miles along is
almighty dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll come on deck, Hutchins,” answers Lord
Westray quickly. He is a good sailor, but the intelligence
does not please him. As he turns to leave the
cabin Léonie steals in. She is drenched with sea
water, and her hair is wringing wet. As she seats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>herself in a corner of the cabin she glances shyly at
Gloria. This latter returns the look with one of
mingled pity and contempt. Léonie’s eyes drop
before that look. For the first time in her life a
feeling of shame rushes over her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is a terrible storm,” she says in a low voice,
as a wave crashes along the deck, part of it finding
its way into the cabin. “I heard one of the men say
he did not think the boat would weather it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“God grant it may not!” answers Gloria sternly,
and then, as if influenced by a sudden impulse, she
continues gently, “Ah! Léonie, child, what could
have tempted you to act so basely? What have I
ever done to you that you should treat me thus?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did my duty,” answers the girl sullenly. “I
did what I was ordered to do. It is my trade.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your trade, child? Good heavens! what are you,
and who ordered you to betray me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My master, Mr. Trackem,” answers Léonie,
simply. “I belong to his detective gang. I’ve served
him ever since I can remember. I’ve never failed
him yet, and he told me not to fail him this time. I
promised I would not, and I have obeyed him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is an evident sincerity in her tone, and Gloria,
with her power of deep insight into character, reads
Léonie’s at a glance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you no mother, no father, my poor Léonie?”
she inquires softly, as she comes over to the girl’s
side, and lays her hand on her curly head.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“Mother, father? No, of course not,” answers
Léonie, with a slight laugh. “They are both dead.
Mr. Trackem always says he’s acted father, mother,
brother, sister, uncle, aunt, and cousin by me. I don’t
quite know what he means by that, but that is what
he says.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Léonie, poor wee Léonie. God! what a
fate! You are not to blame them, my poor child.
Ah! how fully I forgive you,” says Gloria, as with
a sudden impulse she stoops and kisses the girl who
has betrayed her, on the cheek. Only another revelation
has come to her from that cesspool of Modern
Babylon; only another fearful wrong unknown, unstudied,
and unforbidden, brought to light.</p>

<p class='c008'>Léonie looks up quickly. There is a queer expression
in her intelligent eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why do you kiss me? Why do you speak so
kindly? Why do you forgive me for betraying
you?” she inquires rather eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I believe in God,” answers Gloria
gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“God! Why, Mr. Trackem always laughs at
God,” interposes Léonie, with a shrug of her
shoulders. “He always tells me that God is an invention
of the devil, and all clergymen and priests
are fallen angels.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, hush, Léonie; hush, my poor, poor child!
This is terrible. Do not talk in that awful way,”
and the tears start trembling to Gloria’s lovely eyes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Léonie, God is good; He is our friend, He helps
those who pray to Him. If we die to-night we shall
be brought face to face with Him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t understand what you mean,” answers the
girl quietly, “but I do know this. I expected abuse
and reproaches from you, but I have received only
kindness, forgiveness, and gentle words. You have
kissed me, and no one has ever done that before.
I am sorry now I betrayed you. Yes, I am; and I
will try and save you if I can—unless, unless we are
drowned to-night. Do you think we shall be drowned?
You can swim, I know, but I can’t. Mr. Trackem
never taught me how to do that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it comes to swimming I will do my best to help
you, Léonie, at least so long as God gives me strength
to do so,” answers Gloria quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Léonie looks up. In her untrained, untutored
mind Nature is beginning to assert its sway, and
gratitude knocks gently at her heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You would do that for me, would you? You
would try to save my life, after what I have done to
you? Did God teach you that?” she asks with a
quivering voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Léonie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I love God, and I love you. May I give
you a kiss, just as you kissed me? I want to show
you how I love you,” cries Léonie, with a half sob.
“No one has ever been kind to me like this before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She rises as she speaks, and takes one of Gloria’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>hands. This latter is almost startled by the extraordinary
likeness which for a brief moment sweeps
across the girl’s features, a likeness to Bernie Fontenoy.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a terrible crash overhead. It sounds like
falling timber. Again, a rush of feet, and Gloria and
Léonie hear the skipper’s voice raised in loud command.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is ordering out the boat, Léonie. That must
have been the mast that went with that crash. I can
feel by the movement of the ship that she’s helpless.
We shall drift on the rocks, and then she’ll soon break
up,” exclaims Gloria, almost eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we shall be drowned,” answers her companion
in a quiet, composed voice. “I’m not afraid.
I think I should have been if this had happened
yesterday, but I am not now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stops suddenly as the cabin door creaks open
to admit Lord Westray.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looks flurried and anxious, but his glance at
once seeks Gloria.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The smack is practically a wreck,” he says quickly,
“and we are going to take to the boat. I will save
you if you will promise me what I asked you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go!” cries Gloria sternly. “Now you know that
I will die rather than do so. Go, bad man! and may
God have mercy on you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looks at her furiously. But there is no time
for arguing; the skipper is calling to him to hurry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So be it,” he bursts out, with a coarse laugh.
“Your blood be on your own head. I’ll leave you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>and save the gallows the trouble of hanging you.
Come on, girl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These last words are addressed to Léonie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What! go with you, and leave her? I’ll drown
rather!” exclaims Léonie, with a contemptuous laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Drown like a rat, then,” he says with an oath,
as he bangs the door and leaves them. They hear
him scrambling up the little companion ladder, they
hear his voice shouting to the skipper, but the wind
shrieks louder, and the howl of the tempest drowns
all other sounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again there is a rush of water along the deck, a
hissing and washing sound, as the huge wave which
has occasioned it tears madly on its course, part of
it bursting open the cabin door, and flooding the floor
on which Gloria and Léonie are standing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must get on deck, Léonie; we can’t stay here,
child. Here, take hold of my hand; we must keep
together,” exclaims Gloria in a quick, peremptory
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are half-blinded by the thick spray which
sweeps in their faces as they stagger up the ladder,
clinging like grim death to the rails. It is pitch
dark, not the faintest gleam of light gives them the
smallest indication of their whereabouts, only the
white foam of the towering billows now and again
flashes across their aching eyes, blinded by the salt
sea water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Plenty of wreckage is floating about on the deck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and amongst it a life-belt knocks up against one of
Gloria’s ankles. With a pleased exclamation she at
once secures it, and proceeds to slip it over Léonie’s
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If this poor wreck founders,” she explains as she
does so, “this will keep you afloat, child. I am glad
I saw it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you,” says Léonie quickly; “you have not
one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind me, child. You forget that I can
swim. If we manage to stick together, this belt will
be a great help to me, as you will see. And now,
Léonie, we can do nothing but cling to these rails
and trust in God. Keep a good look out for the
waves. When you see one rushing this way don’t try
and stand up against it, it will only knock you backwards,
but bend yourself, hold your breath, and put
your head through it. Quick, have a care, child!”
She utters these last words in a sharp warning tone
as she tightens her grasp on Léonie’s hand. A dense
dark wall seems to tower above them, a swirl and
a rush is all she hears as a monster wave envelops
her and Léonie in its folds. It tears the rail, to which
her left hand clings, from her grasp. She feels herself
lifted up like a straw, and borne forward by the
resistless rush and volume of water. With the desperation
of death in her clutch, her right hand still
grips the still, cold fingers of her young companion,
whose grasp has slackened altogether. A floating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>spar strikes her with some force. She clutches at it,
but it sweeps past her, and is gone as the wave carries
her ever onwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden ebb in the resistless current as if by
magic arrests her course. She feels herself dragged
back along the line she has come. Then the volume
of water abruptly leaves her, and her feet touch the
deck again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gloria is up in a moment; she knows there is not
a minute to spare. In her present position another
such a billow would sweep her clear of the smack
altogether into the raging sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jump up, Léonie!” she shouts, but Léonie never
stirs. As Gloria tugs at her arm to try and arouse
her, she knows by the dead weight of the girl’s body
that Léonie is either dead or insensible.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a supreme effort she raises the now helpless
girl in her arms, and staggers forward to the cabin
with her burden. A wave strikes her as she reaches
it, and dashes her once more to the ground. For a
second time she is swept like a straw along the deck,
and for the second time the ebb arrests her progress,
and leaves her in the same position as before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh God!” she gasps, “how long? This is indeed
a living death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She still grasps the stiff, clammy fingers of the
helpless girl, but hope has left her. She only now
wishes that death may come, and come quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a wild shriek ahead. It rises high above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the wind’s roar. Then a ghastly, unearthly sound
comes out of the blackness of night. Even on death’s
threshold it awakes to attention the senses of Gloria
de Lara. Through the blinding spray she strains the
last glance on life which she feels is left to her.
High above, like a huge black mountain rising suddenly
out of the sea, looms a gigantic apparition. It
towers above her like some fearful, unknown spectre.
There is a flash of light in the air, a loud shout, a
grating sound. Loud o’er all shrieks the tempest
whistle, she feels the smack part from her, a mighty
current sucks her beneath the waves; down, down it
drags her into the bottomless abyss of the ocean’s
awful crater, as the great ship sweeps forward on
its course. Even in this moment of death’s agony
Gloria’s brain is clear. She relaxes her grasp of
Léonie, who, with the life-belt around her, has that
one straw of hope to cling to. As the waters of the
surging Atlantic sweep over her her last cry is to
God; her last vision of the life which she is quitting,
is the face of Evie Ravensdale.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Peace after the storm! Ay, in so far that the
tempest fiend has vanished, leaving behind him
only the low moan of the dying gale. High above
the heights which look down on Eilean Fianan,
Tiorin’s ruins, and the lovely woods of Shona’s Isle,
hover the cloud mists of rising morn, through whose
seemingly tissue veil glint and gleam the joyous
sparks, fantastic offspring of the new-born sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its light, too, is warming those heights with a rosy
glow, and the thick dark woods are pierced with its
golden shafts. Like myriad diamonds sparkle the
raindrops on the pines, and the dew on the glades and
fairy rings, where elfin goblins have held their midnight
orgies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet the gale has left its after-birth in the rolling
swell, which beats in relentless fury on the rock-girt
coast of Shona’s Isle, and lashes the sandy stretch of
beach between Ardtoe and Ru Druimnich. High
tide is rising on those shores, an inland current has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>set in, and in its grasp are the trophies of the storm-fiend’s
victory over the handiwork of man.</p>

<p class='c008'>What are these trophies? Why, here and there a
spar, a tossing barrel, a broken oar. There is something
floating, too, on the heaving swell with which
the waves are making merry, for they carry it to the
sandy beach and drag it back again, toss it still
further inland, and smother it in their spray.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a choice plaything; the salt sea waves are
battling for it hard, but the tide and the inland
current say them nay, and the sandy beach gives it a
rugged welcome. There for a time it may rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>It! But what may it be? A human body,
surely?</p>

<p class='c008'>Out in the bay the yacht <em>Eilean</em> is coasting up and
down. Eager eyes are scanning the waste of water,
and every sign of wreckage is minutely observed.
Ever and anon the voices of the men aloft shout down
some new discovery to the anxious watchers on the
deck below. There is a look of intense agony in the
eyes of the young Duke of Ravensdale as he paces
that snow-white deck. His features are drawn and
haggard, his cheeks are deathly pale, and the lines of
care have seared their mark indelibly across his high
and noble brow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wreckage ahoy!” The men on the look out have
spied another victim of the gale which the inland
current is drawing to Ardnamurchan’s shores. What
can it be? It looks like the back of a whale, or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>huge porpoise turning over in its course. What can
it be?</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Eilean</em> steams towards it, and comes close up
alongside it. No, it is no whale. Only the remnant
of a fishing smack, part of which appears to have been
bodily severed from the whole.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sharp order to man the lifeboat cutter is given.
In a few minutes it is riding the heaving swell. All
eyes are occupied with this new discovery; even the
look-out men have forgotten their duty aloft. Suddenly,
however, Flora Desmond’s voice rings out. She has
been keeping silent, faithful watch by Evie Ravensdale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” she cries.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a moment he is straining with an eager, hungry
look those wild, despairing eyes. She is pointing
away to starboard, and he sees, unmistakably sees, a
human head and shoulders rising up and down on the
grey ocean’s surface. With a low cry he springs
forward. Were it not for Flora’s restraining clutch
he would be overboard and swimming to meet it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait, Evie!” she says imploringly. “The boat
will fetch it in a moment. Don’t go, Evie. Alas, it
is not she!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She has a clear sight has Flora Desmond. She has
caught a glimpse of the dead white face thrown back
as it rises on the crest of the heaving swell, and she
knows that it is not the face of Gloria de Lara. But
when the lifeboat cutter retrieves the body, and it
is hoisted on to the deck, then indeed Flora cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>restrain a cry of horror as she recognises in the set,
rigid face, wide open, staring eyes, and close clenched
teeth the unmistakable features of the girl traitoress,
the female Judas, Léonie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take her from my sight! Oh God! take her
away!” bursts from the pale lips of Evie Ravensdale,
as in a moment the sight of the body before him
drives from his heart the clinging hope that Gloria
is not dead. He knows now that the storm-fiend
has claimed her for his victim, that on this earth the
dark blue eyes will never look their love again.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they bear Léonie from his sight an unnatural
calmness seizes him. He turns to Flora.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must do our duty, Flora. Mine is to see you
safe. We will put the helm about, and steer for the
great free land. And when we get there Flora, you
will see her mother and break it to her, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His words are so cold and measured, his face so
unmoved, that Flora is half fearful for his reason.
She lays her hand gently on his arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not yet, Evie. We must put back to Shona first.
We must not give up the search yet. I mean to
examine the whole coast line between this and Ru
Druimnich.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But she is dead, Flora. Don’t you know she is
dead?” he says coldly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Still, Evie, we may find her dear body. Oh no,
Evie, we must not give up the search; we must seek
on,” answers Flora. She dare not buoy him up with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the fresh hope that Gloria may be alive. The sight
of Léonie has told her this cannot be; yet still she
is resolved more than ever to search on for the body
of her friend. The boatswain is standing near. She
sends him with instructions to the captain, to put
the yacht’s head about and run for Moidart’s Loch,
and then she resumes her watch by Evie Ravensdale.
Time flies, but he does not notice her; his eyes are
staring out over the ocean wave. As they near the
Loch, Nigel Estcourt comes up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A moment, Flora,” he says, motioning her to
come apart. “The doctor is trying to bring Léonie
round. He says life is not extinct. If he can only
succeed, we may be able to extract from her what
has happened. Will you go and see her? I will
keep Ravensdale company while you go down?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must be very gentle, Estcourt. You must
watch him closely, too; I am terribly afraid for his
reason. He seems turned to stone since he set eyes
on Léonie. It is a bad sign. If tears would come
they would relieve him. Ah! God help him. It is
terrible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sighs deeply as she turns from him. Heavy
at heart, yet is Flora’s heart heavier still when it
thinks of the agony which Evie Ravensdale is suffering.
What would she not endure to bring comfort
and peace to his tortured soul!</p>

<p class='c008'>She makes her way down to the cabin where Léonie
is lying; the doctor, with the stewardess and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>assistant, are busy treating her. He looks up hopefully
as Flora enters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She has moved; she has struggled for breath,” he
observes quickly. “Lady Flora, she will live. She
seems to me a mere child. I wonder who she is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Flora does not answer, only she moves over
to the couch, and looks down on the motionless
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is strange, but as she looks she sees the same
remarkable resemblance in this girl to Bernie Fontenoy,
which Gloria had remarked the previous night.
Certainly it is strange, very strange.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a long-drawn sigh, and then a struggle for
breath. Léonie clutches the air with her hands, and
her lips move.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am stifling,” she gasps; “don’t choke me, don’t,
please don’t! Let me breathe, please let me breathe!”
The doctor raises her up slightly, and again Léonie
sighs. Then she draws a long breath. “I love you,”
she says softly; “I love you, Gloria. I love God, too.
I wish I hadn’t betrayed you now. But you have
forgiven me, you have been kind to me, you have
kissed me. Oh! those waves, those dreadful waves!
They will kill you; you have given me the life-belt,
and you have not got one. Take it off, Gloria. Put it
on yourself and leave me. I don’t mind drowning. I
would like to drown for you. Let me kiss you first.
Let me sleep now; let me die.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her hitherto fixed and staring eyes shoot with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>gleam of returning intelligence. She closes them, and
her head falls forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She will sleep now,” observes the doctor, as he
lays her down and turns her on her side, “and when
she awakes she will be all right. A marvellous recovery.
She must have wonderful vitality in her.
We will leave her now quiet, Lady Flora. The yacht
is in motion again. Do we continue the search?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but along the coast. I must go now, doctor.
You will let me know later how the patient is, won’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly,” he answers cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Flora returns on deck. Léonie’s words have puzzled
her. They were clearly addressed to Gloria, and yet
these disjointed utterances can convey but one interpretation
of her fate. Gladly would Flora swallow
a grain of hope, but she knows that it would only
make the reality harder to bear, a reality which she
has faced and accepted already.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gloria,” she whispers, “if you can hear me now,
you will know how true was Flora’s friendship. God
help me, and I will clear your name of that foul charge
laid to your door. Léonie may know something of
it, and she will tell me, for on the threshold of death
has she not said that she loves you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Brave, noble Flora! Self is buried in those generous
words. She never pauses to think of the danger in
which she stands, or the trouble which she must suffer.
But Flora is heroic.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>The yacht is gliding into Moidart’s Loch, and again
the lifeboat cutter is manned and lowered. Flora
has determined to search the whole shore within the
radius of the drifting inland current, which long
experience of these coasts has taught her, draws
wrecks thereto.</p>

<p class='c008'>She will conduct the search in this direction herself,
while, as is now arranged, Estcourt and Archie
Douglasdale will prosecute it along Shona’s rocky
coast in the large gig. Archie had returned to Glenuig
Bay, on the evening before, only to find the fishing box
deserted, his sister, Ravensdale, and Estcourt gone.
One of his trusty Ruglen retainers awaited him, however,
with the information that they had crossed the
hills by Kinlockmoidart for Eilean Shona, where the
duke’s yacht lay anchored. The message which Léonie
had been entrusted to convey was to this very effect,
the duke having further commissioned her to apprise
Gloria of his intended arrival alone, from the Loch
Eilort side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Evie,” says Flora gently, “you will come with
me, will you not? I am going to search the sand
beaches in the cutter up to Ru Druimnich. Come,
Evie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turns almost sullenly. God help him! The
torture he is suffering is writ in his eyes. “She is
dead,” is all he says. But he follows Flora, nevertheless,
and they enter the cutter together. Then he
bows his face in his hands and remains silent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>The search they make is thorough. How could it
be else with Flora in command? And gradually the
cutter creeps slowly on in the direction of the body
on the shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is sighted at length; the look-out man utters his
warning cry, and Flora stands suddenly up and stares
eagerly ahead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, there it lies, high and dry on the sandy beach.
Undoubtedly a human form.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bend to your oars, lads!” she cries. “I’m going
to beach her;” and with that she brings the boat’s
nose sharply for the shore. “Evie,” she says again,
“rouse yourself, Evie. We shall be in the breakers
in a minute. There is a body on the beach.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looks up quickly. Just a gleam of hope is in
his wild eyes, and he is thoroughly on the alert. The
boat rushes forward; it rises high on the first breaker,
and is hurled towards the shore. True is the hand
that holds the tiller and the nerve that guides it.
Straight as a dart does Flora keep the cutter’s nose,
and her voice encourages the oarsmen to their duty,
the seething foam half fills the boat, but it gallantly
rides the water still, as another breaker bears it
onward. Now the keel grates the sandy bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ship oars, lads, and out of her!” Flora commands,
but she sets the example, too.</p>

<p class='c008'>She is in the water waist high. In a moment the
stalwart sailors have obeyed her. Rough, willing
hands grasp the cutter’s sides, and with combined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>force to the seaman’s cheery “Pull, boys, together,”
run her high and dry on to the beach.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Evie Ravensdale has rushed forward. Hope
still surges in his heart. The body is stretched out
upon the sand, the figure is lying on its face, the
hands are clenched. It is easy, however, to see that
the body is not that of a woman; it is plain as plain
can be that it is a man.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sees this at once, and turns away with a bitter,
despairing cry. It was a mad, vain hope to have
indulged in, and yet in his breaking heart, Evie
Ravensdale had prayed to be allowed to look upon
her face once more, ay, even though it were in death.</p>

<p class='c008'>An exclamation from Flora for a moment attracts
him. She has followed him and has turned the body
over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Evie!” she cries, and there is a passionate
ring of triumph in her voice, “though Gloria be
dead, her pure, fair fame is saved. Though God has
taken her, He has dashed to the ground the foul lie
with which they sought to doom her. Look, Evie,
look! Her noble name is cleared.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a startled, eager look he comes to her side.
He sees at his feet the pallid upturned face of a dead
man. This man has dark hair, and a dark thick beard,
moustache and whiskers in which grey hairs are stealing
fast. This man has dark eyes, but the lustre of
life has left them, and his white teeth are clenched
together with a horrid grin.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>He stares down at the corpse below him. The wild,
hungry look in his beautiful eyes is dying now.
Triumph and exultation are there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gloria!” he cries, “my darling, you have
triumphed. They thought they could kill you with a
false and awful lie. There is your answer. Nor
shall your great cause die. I swear to win it for
you! I swear—I swear it now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turns away with a gasping sob. But Flora has
no longer any fear for him. Evie Ravensdale’s vow
will bid him live, live on for Gloria’s sake.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calmly and quietly she turns to the sailors. “We
will carry that body to Dorlin, my lads. Guard it
well. There lies the man whom a too confident jury
declared to be dead, for whose murder the noblest
of women was unjustly condemned. That corpse is
Lord Westray!”</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The blinds are drawn down in the single window of
a small bedroom that overlooks a narrow, dull,
and dingy street, not far removed from Trafalgar
Square. The room, though clean, bears a poverty-stricken
look, for in it, in addition to the bed, there
are only two chairs, an old table, and a dilapidated
sofa with a thin rug covering it. There is a small
washhand-stand in this room besides the other
articles named, but this is all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lying on the bed is a large-eyed, pale, emaciated
young man, upon whose face is unmistakably written
the sign of death. His thin hands, in which the blue
veins show prominently clear, lie listlessly on the
coverlet, though now and again the feeble fingers
twitch nervously thereat, and a hectic flush covers his
pale cheeks. His large hollow eyes have a brilliant,
shining look in them, and they appear to be fixed on
the door of the room which stands slightly ajar.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a sound of the street door downstairs
opening, and the movement of several feet. The young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>man raises himself up and listens eagerly, but the
exertion is too much for him, and he sinks back with
a heavy sigh. The footsteps he has heard are ascending
the staircase, however, and his eyes devour the
door more eagerly than before. It opens and admits
a young girl, a girl who would decidedly be called
pretty were it not for the pinched, careworn look that
rules in her regular and well-cut features. She bears
a great resemblance to the invalid whom we have been
describing. This is not to be wondered at, seeing she
is his twin-sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maggie,” he exclaims in a low voice as she enters,
“have you brought him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Eric,” she answers at once, as she comes to
his bedside, and puts the old faded coverlet at which
his fingers have been twitching smooth and tidy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is he?” again asks the brother in the
same low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Downstairs, Eric. I’ll fetch him up. He’s
brought another gentleman with him. He calls him
a magistrate, I think. He said this gentleman must
take your deposition, because he couldn’t,” says
Maggie, as she opens the door. The next minute
she is running down the somewhat rickety staircase.
Two gentlemen are standing in the passage below.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This way, please, sirs,” she says politely, and
they follow up behind her to Eric Fortescue’s room.
The two gentlemen are Colonel Francis Barrett, divisional
magistrate, and Evie, Duke of Ravensdale.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Eric Fortescue fixes his eyes on the latter, whom he
knows well by sight. He has seen him often before
with Hector D’Estrange.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You wish to see me, my lad?” inquires the duke
in a kind, but sad voice. “Your sister tells me you
have something particular to say to me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answers the sick youth, in his low, feeble
voice; “and I want you, sir, to take down what I say,
and hear me swear it’s all true. I want to tell you
quick, sir, because I’m dying; I can’t last long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a sob over by the window. Maggie is
looking out into the miserable street with her forehead
pressed against one of its cracked panes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say all you have to say very slowly to this gentleman
then, my lad,” answers Evie Ravensdale. “He
is a magistrate, and will take your deposition, and hear
you swear to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to tell you, sir, how wicked I have been.
But God has forgiven me, for Father Vaughan has
heard my confession, and given me absolution. I’m
a Catholic, sir, you know. But Father Vaughan told
me I ought to tell you what I’m going to, because
of the great wrong which other people have suffered
by what I’ve helped to do. So, sir, this is it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m twenty-three years of age, sir, and I have
earned my living since a boy, and since poor mother
died, in the service of Mr. Trackem. He’s a private
detective agent, sir, and something else besides. He
always said I was a sharp lad, and that I did things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>quick for him, so that when I was eighteen he made
me his head clerk, and used to tell me all about his
affairs and jobs. It was he and I who arranged that
attack on Mrs. de Lara, and several days before it
I had watched her every night when she came out
for her evening stroll, and the night before the attack
I got into her sitting-room while she was out, and
stole a lot of her note-paper and some of her writing.
I was at Mr. D’Estrange’s trial, sir, and all what Mrs.
de Lara and Miss Vernon and you swore to was quite
true, and nearly all what Mr. Trackem said was a lie.
Well, sir, after Mr. D’Estrange and you and Miss
Vernon rescued Mrs. de Lara, Mr. Trackem and I and
Lord Westray held a consultation. His lordship was
very much put about, and swore he would be revenged.
He offered me and Mr. Trackem a deal of money to
help him, and then Mr. Trackem hatched the plan,
sir. I can imitate handwriting well, and he made
me write two letters copying Mrs. de Lara’s handwriting.
One was to her maid, saying she was going
up to London, and the other to Mr. Trackem, telling
him to keep the house in Verdegrease Crescent for
her and Lord Westray. And then Lord Westray
himself wrote several letters in the vein described by
Mr. Trackem at the trial. And then, sir, Mr. Trackem
arranged with his lordship all about buying a poor
man’s body, as soon as one could be found suitable
for the purpose. You look startled, sir, but it’s not
difficult to do a job of that sort in some parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>London, and, in fact, one was soon got. We put Lord
Westray’s gold ring on one of its little fingers, and
hung the chain and locket about its neck, and it was
me, sir, that took it down by night and buried it in
Mrs. de Lara’s grounds where it was found, and close
to it I buried the clothes which Lord Westray was
wearing the night that Mr. D’Estrange fired at him.
By this time Lord Westray had gone abroad, but it
was all arranged that in two years’ time or so Mr.
D’Estrange was to be accused of the murder. When
that time had elapsed, anonymous letters were sent
to the present Lord Westray, telling him all about
the murder, and then Mr. Trackem went and told his
lordship what he knew. Everything happened as we
wanted it to. The matter was placed in Mr. Trackem’s
hands; he communicated with the police, and he
employed me and a dog of his called Nero, a half-bred
bloodhound, to hunt the grounds of Mrs. de
Lara’s place at night in search of the body and clothes.
I had previously given Nero a lesson or two as to their
whereabouts, so he soon traced them in the presence
of the police. This is all I know, sir. On my dying
oath I swear that Mr. D’Estrange did not murder
Lord Westray. The wound received was slight,
and soon healed up. This is my confession, sir. I
know I did wrong, but I was a poor boy, and I was
sorely tempted by the money offered me. I loved
a girl, sir. She was called Léonie, and she was in
Mr. Trackem’s service. I wanted to marry her, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>didn’t dare ask her till I got money. But God has
punished me. I shall never see Léonie again; she’s
gone away, I don’t know where, and now I’m dying.
If it had not been for dear sister Maggie I should
have been dead by now, for Lord Westray never paid
me the money he promised to; least if he gave it to
Mr. Trackem I never got it. Not that I want it now.
I would not touch it for all the world, indeed I would
not. And now, sir, I want to ask you to forgive me as
I know God has, and I want you to ask Mrs. de Lara
and Mr. D’Estrange to forgive me too. I think if
they saw me as you do now, sir, they would pity and
forgive me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young man pauses, and listens eagerly for a
reply. The hectic flush has deepened in his cheeks,
and his eyes gleam with the fire that heralds death
more brilliantly than ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My poor lad, I do forgive you, as I hope to be
forgiven myself,” says Evie Ravensdale softly.
Terrible and horrible as is the plot which this dying
youth has disclosed to him, yet in the presence of
that death which he can see approaching fast, he
feels that he must forgive.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Mrs. de Lara, Mr. D’Estrange?” persists
Eric Fortescue anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. D’Estrange is dead,” is all that Evie Ravensdale
can trust himself to reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eric Fortescue starts up in his bed, and stares
wildly at the duke.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>“Not hanged, sir? Oh God! not hanged, sir? I
thought he escaped, sir?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A hollow racking cough seizes him. The blood dyes
his lips as he falls back helplessly as before. In a
moment Maggie is by his side with her left arm
tenderly round him, and supporting him in a sitting
position, as she wipes the blood from his lips with an
old handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you anything, my girl, to moisten his lips
with?” inquires the duke, horrified at the sight before
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir,” she answers in a low, hopeless voice.
“He had his last orange yesterday, and I have not
a penny left except enough for the rent. I daren’t
use that. They would turn us out if that was not
paid punctual.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Evie Ravensdale shudders; words would not paint
his feelings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, Maggie,” he says, “here is some money.
Run, my girl, and buy what you think he will fancy,
and we will stay with him until you return. At least,
colonel, I won’t ask you to. I know your time is
precious. Will you swear this lad, and let him sign
that deposition, and then I won’t keep you? But I
want to stay myself and see him comfortable before
I leave.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a happy smile lighting up her face Maggie
Fortescue hurries from the room, and then Eric swears
to and signs the deposition. The signature is tremblingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and weakly penned, still there it is, a living
witness to the truth of Speranza and Gloria de Lara’s
innocence.</p>

<p class='c008'>These formalities completed, Colonel Barrett takes
his departure with the precious document in his safe
keeping. Its contents will ring through the world
before another sun is down. No sooner has he gone,
than Eric Fortescue turns his eyes once more on the
duke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad he’s gone, sir,” he says slowly, and
speaking with difficulty, “because I want to tell you
one more thing very particular, sir. It will be my
last words, I think, for I feel I’m sinking. It’s about
Léonie, sir. I want to tell you who she is, sir. Mr.
Trackem told me, sir, long ago. Her mother was Nell
Stanley. Of course you know who I mean, sir—the
big beauty whom your father, sir, took away from Lord
Beauladown. It was she they fought that duel over.
Well, Léonie is Nell Stanley’s child, and her father
was the late Duke of Ravensdale. He treated her
mother very bad, poor thing, and forsook her altogether
after she got disfigured with the small-pox. She came
to live in Verdegrease Crescent, and earned her living
on the streets. But she did not live long, and died
at Mr. Trackem’s house when Léonie was three years
old. Mr. Trackem was beginning detective business
then. Léonie was so pretty and so smart, that he
kept her and trained her to the work, and that’s how
I came to know her, sir. And I did love her, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>was my love which tempted me to do all the wicked
things I did. But God has punished me, sir. I am
dying. I shall never see Léonie any more. Still I
should be happy if I knew you would care for her,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He says the last words in a whisper. He has
used all the strength that he possesses to make this
last statement. Poor Eric Fortescue! <em>It is his last.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Maggie’s footstep is on the stairs; she is coming
up so quickly. She has bought some grapes amongst
other things with the duke’s gift.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look, Eric dear!” she exclaims, as she hurries in,
and holds up a big bunch of fine black grapes for him
to view. “Look what I’ve got you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Eric’s eyes are closed, and the hectic flush has
given way to a deathly pallor. He has made his last
effort on this earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sets the things down on the rickety table with
a low cry, and comes over to the bedside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eric,” she pleads, “look at Maggie, Eric, poor
Maggie; she’s brought you such nice things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He opens his big eyes, the brilliant gleam in them
has died out; there is a dead, heavy, vacant look in
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going, Maggie,” she hears him mutter; “tell
Father Vaughan I <em>did</em> tell all. There’s mother,
Maggie; how pretty she looks. She’s in a garden
full of flowers and fruits and pretty things. The
sun is so bright and the air so pure. And there’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Léonie—dear, pretty little Léonie. Don’t hold me,
Maggie; I must go to her, I must——”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Maggie, bending over her twin brother, hears
his voice grow still, feels on her cheek the last breath
of life that goes forth with these words, for Eric
Fortescue is dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Maggie! She is weak, and ill, and suffering.
For weeks she has worked hard to support her brother,
and watched by his bedside in her spare hours. She
has stinted herself of food to buy him little delicacies.
But of late, work has been hard to get, and during
the last week she has obtained but scant employment,
barely sufficient to buy bread with. At this moment
food has not passed her lips for thirty-six hours, and
the last bite she had, was a few crusts soaked in water,
the remnants of some bread from the crumb of which
she had made her brother a little bread and milk.
Poor Maggie! It is as well. He wants no bread
and milk now.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she does not cry or sob when she knows it is
all over. She merely closes the dull, staring, lustreless
eyes, smooths the worn coverlet once more, joins
his hands as if in prayer, and drawing a small
crucifix from her chest, kisses it, and places it
between his thin white fingers. Then she turns
to Evie Ravensdale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is dead, your Grace,” she says meekly; “it
is God’s will. I will never forget your kindness in
forgiving him. Poor Eric! he was a good lad if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>had not been led astray. Can I fetch you a cab, your
Grace?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her voice is quiet, almost matter-of-fact, and yet
Maggie Fortescue is alone in the world, hungry, tired,
weary, and penniless.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Maggie,” he says gently, “certainly not. I
am going away now, but I will send some one to help
you. And when you have buried your poor brother,
you must come to this address and let me know. I
have several things to ask you, and you must let me
help you to earn a comfortable living.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“God bless your Grace!” she answers in a low
voice. Then, as Evie Ravensdale turns to go, she
holds out some silver to him, saying as she does so:</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the change, your Grace, out of what you
gave me to get those things for Eric.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep it, keep it, Maggie,” he says huskily; and
then he turns and leaves the poor scantily furnished
room in which he has learned so much, and in which
he has established, absolutely and completely, the
innocence of the woman whose lost image is ever
before his eyes.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>And while Eric Fortescue unburdens his soul of
the heavy sin that has stained it, and bears it,
purified and triumphant, through the portals of a
new life, there is confusion and rage in the heart of
Mr. Trackem as he sits at his business table hastily
examining papers and committing them to the safe
keeping of a large fire, which consumes each consignment
as it is thrown in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Trackem’s usually confident and satisfied expression,
has given place to one of anxiety and fear.
That he is disturbed is evident.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Curse the fellow!” he keeps muttering to himself;
and then a gleam of baffled rage shoots from his
cunning eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>There comes a knock at the door, a peculiar knock.
He is evidently acquainted with it, for he looks up
eagerly and calls out, “Come in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A woman enters obedient to the summons. She is
a woman with a plump, artificial-looking figure, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>hair is yellow, and her eyes, eyelashes, and eyebrows
are dark. An unmistakable sign of powder and
rouge affords to her cheeks an appearance of pinkness,
which all women who decorate themselves in this
manner verily believe looks natural and becoming.
Alas! if they could only see themselves as others
see them! She is overdressed is this woman, with
plenty of rings on her fingers and jewellery about
her, and her whole air unmistakably stamps her for
what she is.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” inquires Mr. Trackem in an impatient
voice, as she comes in. “How you dawdle, Victoire!
Were they there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she replies at once. “I saw the duke, and
a strange gentleman, and the girl Maggie, all go into
the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you follow and hear what Eric said?” again
asks Mr. Trackem. He never stops the work upon
which he is engaged, in spite of his anxiety to hear
what she has to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How could I?” she answers peevishly. “I’m not
a fairy who can become invisible at will. I saw them
go in, that’s all, and then I hurried back here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Curse him!” is all Mr. Trackem vouchsafes in
reply, but he works away harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hanging over the back of a chair close to his table
is a great-coat, and on the seat lies a pot hat, pair of
gloves, and walking-stick. On the ground below the
chair stands a small black business bag. Into this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>bag Mr. Trackem ever and anon commits a paper from
out the heap that he is destroying.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a long pause. Then Victoire speaks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you going to do? I suppose you won’t
be safe here now?” she inquires.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Safe!” he laughs angrily, “rather not. I suppose
they’ll have the bloodhounds on me before an
hour’s out. No, Victoire, I must cut it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what’s to become of me?” she asks, somewhat
aghast. “You’ll leave me some money, Trackem,
and let me know where you are going to?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Money! I’ve deuced little left of that now;
and as for telling you where I’m going to, I’m not
such a fool. Why, you’d blurt it out any moment,”
and Mr. Trackem laughs sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what’s to become of me?” she again inquires.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Damned if I know!” he replies impatiently. “I
don’t suppose you’ll have much trouble in making a
living along with some one else, same way as you’ve
made it here. You don’t suppose I can saddle myself
with you now, and drag you about wherever I go?
What a fool you are, Victoire!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you are going to throw me up?” she asks
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haven’t I told you I can’t drag you about all over
the place?” he answers savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you’ll leave me a little money, won’t you?”
she says, with a half sob. “I haven’t got a farthing,
Trackem.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“Then you must go and make it, my girl,” he
replies coarsely. “You’ll have no difficulty in doing
that, and I’ve no money to give you. You know
perfectly well that I’ve nigh ruined myself with lending
all the money that I did to that Lord Westray,
and now he’s dead I can’t get it back. Curse him!
I wish I’d never seen him, or had anything to do with
that Mrs. de Lara and her daughter. They’ve beat us
fair and square, Victoire, even though the daughter
be dead. Fair and square.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate them both,” she bursts out with unreasoning
fury. “They are the cause of my misery now. Oh,
Trackem! don’t forsake me. I might have had a
comfortable, respectable home with Charles, but I
threw it up to be with you. What did I do it for
but because I loved you? I’m a bad one, no doubt;
but at least I loved you, and do love you still. Don’t
forsake me! I’ll stop here and put the trackers off
the scent, and do all I know how to help you, only
promise me you’ll let me know where you are
by-and-by, and let me join you again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A brilliant thought strikes Mr. Trackem. He has
not the slightest intention of doing as she asks, but
it will be just as well, he thinks, to lead her to believe
that he will. And meantime she may be useful in
assisting his escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Victoire,” he says in a more conciliatory
voice, “you’re a good girl and a faithful one. Look
here, here’s five pounds, and I’ll send you more soon.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Stay here as long as you can, and keep the bloodhounds
at bay. If the staff get uneasy, you can hoodwink
them. When you change your address put it in the
<cite>Times</cite>. And now, my girl, give us a kiss. I must
be off. Every moment makes it more risky.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He has finished burning his compromising papers,
has taken up his hat, stick, and gloves, thrown his
coat over one arm, and picked up the business bag.
He is quite ready to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>She throws her arms round his neck. Fallen,
degraded, wicked as is Victoire Hester, yet she loves
this vile, scheming, and contemptible wretch, for
whose sake she has steeped her soul in the inky dye
of sin, and turned from the path of honour and of
truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There now, there now, that’s enough, old girl,”
he says hastily, and as she unclasps her hands from
about his neck, he steps quickly towards the door and
opens it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Remember, Victoire, you baulk the trackers,” he
says significantly, and then he passes out from her
presence, and is gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>She hears the front door open and shut again, and
springs to the window. She can just catch sight of
him as he passes along the Crescent. It is her last
glimpse, and in spite of his promise to the contrary,
she feels that it is. But Victoire Hester for the
moment forgets herself. In the presence of the danger
which threatens the man she loves, she becomes calm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>All trace of his hasty departure must be quickly obliterated.
She feels that this is imperatively necessary.
Quickly she sets to work, tidies up his table, sets the
room neat, and with her own hands collects the burnt
paper and carries it off. Then she opens the windows
to let out the smell which the burning paper has
emitted, heaps more coals on the fire, and moves into
Mr. Trackem’s bedroom to arrange his things. In
less than an hour all is ship-shape and tidy as usual.
There is not a sign of hasty departure.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few hours later there comes a ring at the front
door. Victoire has given instructions that she will
see any one that calls. She has often before undertaken
this duty in Mr. Trackem’s absence, and the
servant sees nothing strange in the order. He therefore
admits the new-comers, and shows them into
Mr. Trackem’s business room. These two new-comers
are men. They are dressed in dark clothes, and they
both seat themselves to await his coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Run him in pretty sharp, eh?” observes one of
them with a smile, as the door closes on the
servant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haven’t got him yet, Bush,” retorts the other
quietly. Inspector Truffle is not of so sanguine a
temperament as is Inspector Bush.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As good as though,” replies Inspector Bush confidently,
but he stops abruptly as he hears steps
approaching. Again the door of Mr. Trackem’s business
room opens. Victoire enters. There is blank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>disappointment on Inspector Bush’s face. Victoire
sees it as she fixes her dark eyes full upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-afternoon, gentlemen,” she says quietly;
“you wished to see Mr. Trackem? I am sorry to
say he is away, but I expect him back the day after
to-morrow. His head clerk is ill too, but I can do
anything for you in Mr. Trackem’s place. I always
attend to his affairs in his absence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She smiles good-naturedly on the blank, nonplussed
detectives. She seems to give her attention especially
to Inspector Bush. Inspector Truffle rises to the
occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, madam,” he says briskly, “but I fear
the business we have come about can only be transacted
with Mr. Trackem. The fact is, madam, we came to
settle an account that we owe him, and which would
require Mr. Trackem’s signature to be of any use as
a receipt. And the worst of it is, we are going away,
and shall not be able to call again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He fixes a piercing glance upon her as he speaks,
but Victoire is equal to the occasion. She does not
believe a word of Inspector Truffle’s statement, and
divines perfectly well what his business is.</p>

<p class='c008'>She assumes a disappointed air as she exclaims,</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a great pity. But what is to be done? I do
not think I can possibly get Mr. Trackem back before
the day after to-morrow. However, I will telegraph
to him, and will send you his reply. Will you favour
me with your address?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Here is a poser. Victoire sees it, and inwardly
chuckles. But again Inspector Truffle attempts to
uphold the fair fame of detective smartness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly, madam,” he replies, as he takes out
his card-case and hands her a card therefrom, upon
which she reads the address of a well-known firm of
solicitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>She assumes a most deferential manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think Mr. Trackem will make every effort to
be here by to-morrow. I will telegraph at once, and
unless you hear to the contrary, will you kindly call
on Mr. Trackem at the same hour to-morrow, if you
please, gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Truffle is triumphant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will,” he answers. “Well, thank you, madam.
Good-afternoon to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-afternoon, gentlemen,” she replies with
admirably feigned regret ringing in her voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inspectors Truffle and Bush betake themselves to
the comfortable hansom that awaits them. As it
rattles along, the former breaks silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We managed that capitally,” he says with a
chuckle. “Quite took her in. The chink of money
soon made her open her ears. Bet you it brings
Mr. Trackem home pretty quick.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answers Inspector Bush. “I didn’t like the
look of the woman when she first came in, but she
took the bait readily enough. Poor things, those sort
of women. No match for the likes of us, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Inspector Truffle has had more experience than
Inspector Bush, and doesn’t agree there. But he
thinks, as he drives along, that anyhow <em>this one</em> is
quite taken in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Is she, though? You’ll find out your mistake,
inspector, when you call to-morrow with Inspector
Bush <em>at the same hour</em>!</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The lights are low and softly subdued in Evie
Ravensdale’s private study or sanctum in Montragee
House, the blinds and curtains are drawn, the
fire casts its flickering shadows on the ceiling and
walls as ever and anon the little gas-jets from the
coals shoot forth their vivid blaze, relapsing immediately
after into smoke and gloom. The sounds of
mimic warfare which they produce are the only ones
which break the stillness prevailing, unless it be the
low breathing of the dog Nero, which is stretched
upon the hearthrug.</p>

<p class='c008'>He would hardly, however, lie there so quietly and
contentedly, if he were the only occupant of the room,
for a dog’s chief characteristic is love of company,
loneliness being his pet aversion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor is he alone, as we shall see if we glance at the
big armchair drawn up in front of the fire, and looking
again, perceive that it is occupied.</p>

<p class='c008'>The figure which sits there, is in truth very still
and silent. It is laying back with its knees crossed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>and its arms resting on each side of the chair. Its
head is slightly bent forward, and its dreamy eyes
glitter in the firelight, which they are roving as if
in search of an object prized but lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>What does Evie Ravensdale see in that flickering
firelight which appears suddenly to arrest his gaze?
It must be some cherished object indeed, judging by
the happy smile which for a few brief moments lights
up the otherwise sad face, on which melancholy has
stamped its mournful features. That which he sees
is but a passing vision however, for the smile quickly
dies away, and leaves the dark eyes searching again
amidst the glowing coals, for the picture that has
come and vanished. Above the fireplace, shrouded on
either side by heavy curtains of old-gold plush, hangs
the oil painting which represents his first meeting
with Hector D’Estrange. It is only when alone that
Evie Ravensdale draws those curtains aside, and then
none can see the emotion which the picture arouses
in him. For the memories which it awakens, albeit
noble and tender, are painful, recalling, as they do,
the image of her whom in life he has most cherished
and now lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is sitting there alone, but his mind is busy and
his brain hard at work. The sudden revulsion of
feeling throughout the country, aroused by the discovery
of the drowned body of Lord Westray and
the tragic fate of Gloria de Lara, coupled with the
published declarations of Léonie Stanley, and later on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>the startling dying depositions of Eric Fortescue, have
all combined to create this reaction in favour of the
D’Estrangeite party. The Devonsmere Government,
weak in composition and intellect, at once succumbed,
and Lord Pandulph Chertsey, the free lance of the
National party, stepped into the Duke of Devonsmere’s
shoes. But Lord Pandulph was too clever and
practical to attempt to govern the fiery steed of public
opinion with mimic reins of power. He appealed to
that tribunal which alone has the right to nominate
its rulers, the people, and demanded of the country
its mandate. And now the country, without demur
or hesitation, has spoken out in no uncertain tone.
The light of a pure and noble life has penetrated the
darkness of opposition and prejudice, and has fulfilled
the prophecy which in childhood Gloria de Lara predicted.
The cause of right and justice has triumphed,
and the reign of selfishness, greed, and monopoly has
passed away.</p>

<p class='c008'>By a glorious majority D’Estrangeism has won.
The Progressists are nowhere, and the Nationals
have been returned mutilated in numbers. The
D’Estrangeites, recruited by sixty additional seats,
declare the country’s will, and Evie Ravensdale, at
the command of his sovereign, has formed a Ministry,
known under the name of the Second D’Estrangeite
Cabinet.</p>

<p class='c008'>These changes have been rapid. Little more than a
month has passed away since the death of Gloria de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Lara resounded through the world, and already the
vision which her childhood’s genius conjured up as
she spoke to the waves of the blue Adriatic, and predicted
victory, is on the eve of realisation. For even
as it had been her first act of power to bring in a
bill for the complete emancipation of women, so is it
Evie Ravensdale’s intention to do likewise.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the position is different. When Hector
D’Estrange submitted his bill to the Commons, he knew
that for many reasons it was doomed, the first, and
foremost being that the country had not spoken, or
pronounced unmistakably for or against the change.
On this occasion there can be no misunderstanding
however, for the Parliament returned gives the
D’Estrangeites a majority over the other parties in
the House combined, and in plain words declares the
will of the people. But there is just this difference
again. Whereas the first bill was introduced to the
Commons, the second, in virtue of Evie Ravensdale’s
rank, must make its <i><span lang="fr">début</span></i> in the Lords. Will this
latter assembly accept it? It remains to be seen.
Yet surely in the face of the country’s mandate, the
peers will submit to the people’s wishes!</p>

<p class='c008'>No wonder then that the brain of the young Premier
is busy and hard at work. In three hours from now,
he will be submitting the bill to his peers, and appealing
to them in the name of justice and right, in
the name of fairness and honesty, in the name of the
great dead, to breathe upon it the breath of life.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Surely the victory which the child Gloria foretold,
which the young genius foresaw, is now at length to
be won. Ah! surely yes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My darling,” he whispers softly, as the vision,
which for a few brief moments has shone in the
gleaming coals, passes away in the changing light
thereof, “my darling, would to God that you were
here, would to God that I had the counsel of your
clear brain, the courage of your strong heart to support
me! Yet hear me, Gloria, and help me to keep
my vow. Have I not sworn to dedicate my life to
the great work which your noble genius conceived and
sought to accomplish? And with God’s help I will
be the faithful servant of your great cause. So help
me God!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He rises as he speaks, and fixes his gaze on the
painting above him. It almost seems to him as
though the figure of Hector D’Estrange portrayed
therein, stands there in living life. He can hardly
realise, as he looks at the beautiful face, that the spirit
which made Gloria so noble in life, does not animate
it now. In the subdued light and the flickering gleam
of the fire, the features look living and real; to Evie
Ravensdale they bring high resolves and noble inspirations,
which only the influence of that which is great
and lofty, can awaken.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>Estcourt is late in the House, too late to hear the
whole of the Premier’s speech; he has been delayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>by business of pressing moment. About five o’clock in
the afternoon, a telegram had been put into his hands,
the contents of which had dazed and struck him well-nigh
speechless. He could not summon courage to
credit its contents. Recovering however, from his
surprise, his first impulse had been to seek his chief
and lay the telegram before him. Second thoughts
had decided him, however, on not doing so, and he
had elected instead to send off a long telegram himself.
This telegram bore reference entirely to the
one which he had received, and was addressed to a
friend in South America. During the remainder of
the day Estcourt has been anxiously and feverishly
awaiting the reply. So important does he regard this
reply, that he continues to await it, and in the House
of Lords, crowded by every active member belonging
to it, he alone is absent. It is natural, therefore, that
his absence should have caused both surprise and
comment, especially as he is a prominent member of
the Second D’Estrangeite Ministry.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has come in now, however, and his colleagues
eye him curiously. They cannot help noticing the
suppressed look of excitement in his face, and the
eager, restless expression in his eyes. Estcourt’s
ordinary manner is so quiet and calm that these unusual
symptoms are all the more noticeable and surprising.
But the duke is still speaking; attention
is soon again riveted on what he is saying, and
Estcourt is enabled, at any rate, to hear the latter part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>of a speech whose persuasive eloquence and oratorical
power, amaze the House, Evie Ravensdale never
before having been regarded but as a common-place
speaker, and orator of mediocre talent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On this solemn occasion,” he is saying as Estcourt
comes in, “I beseech of your lordships to cast aside
the cloak of old prejudices and selfish monopoly, and
obey the unmistakable will of the country, which has
appointed a House of Commons pledged to carry this
great act of human justice and reparation. I appeal
to you to show on this occasion a true courage worthy
of men, and abolish for ever from the Statute Book
those disabilities under which women are deprived of
rights to which they are entitled by reason of their
common humanity with man. The stale arguments
of past days can no longer be advanced in opposition
to this bill. The false and brutal pretexts which
formerly were adopted to reason away the human
rights of women, can no longer be resorted to. Woman
has triumphantly established the fact that her mental
capacities are equal to man’s—ay, and her physical
powers of strength and endurance as well, where she
has been given fair chances and fair play. There
remains but one argument against the removal of her
disabilities and the triumphant assertion of the
principles of this bill; that one argument is selfishness.
Men are unwilling, in many instances, to allow
women whom they have held in subjection so long, to
assume a position of equality with themselves. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>men object to remove the halo with which they have
self-crowned themselves; they object, in fact, to share
with women the good things of this earth. There is
but one definition of this attitude of opposition, and
that is selfishness, my lords, pure and unadulterated
selfishness. But the time has come when this selfishness
is too glaring and apparent to pass from sight,
when it must be faced, fought with, and conquered.
On its defeat depends—not the welfare of man only,
but the welfare and advance of the world. We have
sought to rule against the laws of Nature too long,
we have sought, by artificial means, to keep the world
going, and we have failed. What has the rule of man
accomplished? The vain gratification of a few, the
misery of millions and hundreds of millions. War
has been invented to glorify men, to uphold dynasties
loathed, in many instances, by the people; vice and
immorality rage for the gratification of the ruler man;
philanthropy exists to patch up the sores and abscesses
brought about in Society by his excesses; the starving,
the criminal, and the miserable, are supported by taxes
wrung from the people. Religion spreads abroad its
thousands of arms, each one asserting its sole right
to be, but the fact remains: war is spreading, crime
increasing, immorality assuming giant proportions,
misery, disease, and wrongdoing growing mightier
day by day, while the forces that could and would
stay these horrors, still wear the badge of slavery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I appeal to your lordships to face these facts, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>act upon them generously and courageously. From
our midst a great and commanding figure has but
lately passed away,—one who began in childhood an
heroic and courageous resistance to wrong, and who
maintained that resistance through her all too short
career. Gloria de Lara, in the person of Hector
D’Estrange, triumphantly established the fact of
woman’s equality with man, and undeniably asserted
the right of her sex to share with him in the government
of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I ask your lordships to consider in a generous
manner the motives which first prompted the great
heart of Gloria de Lara to do battle for her sex, and
which ultimately strengthened its resolve to maintain
the contest to the last. Was it not a dawning comprehension
of the terrible wrong under which her
mother had become an outcast in this world, shunned
and despised by Society at large? Did not Gloria de
Lara recognise that in woman’s unnatural position lay
the root of the evil? Then, as she grew up, and personally
made herself acquainted with the woes afflicting
Society, did she not struggle to remedy this position,
recognising therein the key to human suffering? I
bear testimony to her life of patient, unwearying
research amidst the suffering and slaving classes.
This it was that gave her such a grasp of her subject,
when in the House of Commons she sought to unveil
to the members thereof the horrors that existed. The
dream of her life was, to be spared in order to carry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>great social measures of reform, but she recognised
the fact that to do this effectually, woman must first
be placed on the level of equality with man. For this
she struggled, for this she fought on against overwhelming
odds. I need not dwell on the false and brutal
charge which was brought against her, which forced
her to disclose her sex, which condemned her to die,
and which—when rescued by her own Women Guards—made
her an outcast and a wanderer, and a felon
in the eyes of the law. The falsity of this detestable
lie has been abundantly proved in the discovery of
the dead body of the man who ruined and blasted her
mother’s life, who brought about her own pathetic and
irredeemable death. In her name I appeal for justice,
and I confidently believe that I shall not appeal in
vain. I desire that the division shortly to be taken
shall seal the fate of the measure on behalf of victory
or defeat. You have the voice of the country ringing
in your ears, but high above that voice should sound
the loud appeal, which a great and noble example
sends forth, the appeal of the glorious dead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sits down amidst a storm of applause, unusual
in this august and dignified assembly. He hardly
hears it; he takes no note of the varied scene around
him. Evie Ravensdale sees before him the face of
but one being, that being Gloria de Lara. Is not
her spirit near encouraging, upholding, and leading
him on to victory?</p>

<p class='c008'>But he is awakened from his dream at the call of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>duty. The division is being taken at last, and all
wait in breathless expectation for the result.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Content’s have it!” By a majority of 107
the peers obey the country’s mandate, and acknowledge
the people’s will as law. Gloria has triumphed.
That which she predicted is realised, the vow which
she made is accomplished. Ah! in this moment of
victory, who would not wish her here, instead of in
the cold arms of death?</p>

<p class='c008'>Of death? Silence is being called for, and Lord
Estcourt is endeavouring to make himself heard. He
is successful at last.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish to explain to the House,” he begins, “why
I was not in my place when my noble friend began
his speech. My excuse will be acceptable to this
House, I feel sure. The fact is, I received a telegram
containing startling intelligence, so startling that I
conceived it to be a hoax. I took steps to ascertain
the truth, and am satisfied of the authenticity of the
first intelligence. I have to announce to your lordships
the glorious news that Gloria de Lara is not
dead. By God’s almighty goodness she is alive—alive
to witness the triumph of her cause. Truly indeed
you may exclaim with me in accepting this wonderful
intelligence, it is God’s will—it is the hand of God.”</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Gloria de Lara lives!” The words have rung
far and wide o’er land and distant sea. They
have entered the homes of the great, the cottages of
the poor, they have brought joy to millions of weary
hearts, who know that while that great name breathes
the breath of life, reform cannot die.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, Gloria lives, lives! But how? Have we not
seen her in the clutch of Death?</p>

<p class='c008'>We left her therein. We left her being borne down
by the resistless, sucking whirlpool of the sinking
smack as the massive trading steamer, which had cut
clean through the frail barque, bore on its course. As
she parted her hold of Léonie, Gloria had clutched
the sinking wreck with that strong and tenacious
grip which the drowning alone can command. The
lighter and severed portion of the wreck had been
swept forward by an enormous wave, which carried
with it likewise the body of Léonie, supported on the
crest of the sea by the life-belt, which Gloria had tied
around her.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>But the bright, flashing light which had danced
in Gloria’s eyes ere she was borne downwards, had
searched from stem to stern the helpless, storm-tossed
craft, and the anxious gaze of the man on the look
out had been able to detect those two frail human
forms. As the shout of “Boat ahoy!” had rung out
through the shrieking storm, the steamer had crashed
through her frail antagonist in the manner already
described. But the skipper of <em>The Maid of Glad
Tidings</em>, as such the steamer was named, was brave
and humane. In spite of the storm he had skilfully
brought his vessel to the rescue. The electric light
had swept the sea in search of the unlucky boat, and
after a time a portion of her had been sighted, a
helpless and dismantled wreck. Yet to that wreck
a human form was clinging.</p>

<p class='c008'>A brave crew had manned the lifeboat, and with
the true pluck of British seamen, had fought against
terrible odds to rescue that one lone, helpless creature.
They succeeded; and amidst that black night and
howling storm, another deed of heroism had silently
written its tale upon the scrolls of British fame.
And as Captain Ruglen’s gaze had first fallen on the
rescued victim of the storm, he had started. He was
a big, powerful man, with a tender, kindly heart.
When, therefore, he bent over the silent figure and
raised it in his arms, bearing it below to his own
cabin, his men only saw in this act another evidence
of the skipper’s kindly disposition. Yet in that brief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>glance, Gloria de Lara had been recognised; for what
devoted adherent of her cause who had ever looked
upon her face could forget it? Certes, not Captain
Ruglen. A member of Ruglen clan, he was also an
out-and-out D’Estrangeite; nor was this the first time
that he had been in the company of Hector D’Estrange.
But he knew that the once successful and powerful
idol of Society was now a hunted and doomed felon,
with a large reward out for her apprehension. He
knew that many of his crew were not D’Estrangeites,
and that it might go hard with him and her if she
were recognised. Thus had he borne her to his
cabin, determined there to protect and shield her, and
carry her to the far-away free shores of the Spanish
main, whither <em>The Maid of Glad Tidings</em> was bound.</p>

<p class='c008'>Reaching it, Gloria’s first act had been to wire to
Speranza de Lara in North America, and to Estcourt
in England. As yet she had heard no tidings of the
wonderful events which had led up to the triumph
of her cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>But those tidings sped back to her along the electric
wire. They came in the shape of a loving message of
welcome from the man she loved. From Evie Ravensdale
she learnt how victory had crowned her efforts;
from him came the tidings of great joy that her vow
had been accomplished.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c008'>Once more the vast crowd of London surges in the
streets,—a happy, joyous, good-humoured crowd nevertheless.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Every house is gay with bunting and flags,
and triumphal arches are in every street through
which the procession will pass along.</p>

<p class='c008'>What procession?</p>

<p class='c008'>Why, is not this the day upon which Gloria de Lara
is to reach our shores, and is she not to be welcomed
back and publicly honoured in the great Hall of Liberty,
where, when last she stood, she was a condemned and
hunted felon?</p>

<p class='c008'>The yacht <em>Eilean</em> has gone to meet her. It has
joined the <em>Colossus</em>, in which Gloria has made her
passage from South America at the mouth of the
Thames. The party on board the <em>Eilean</em> consists
solely of Speranza de Lara, Flora Desmond, and her
child, a fine girl of seven years, together with Evie
Ravensdale, Estcourt, Léonie, and Rita Vernon. All,
with the exception of Speranza, wear the white gold-braided
uniform of the White Guards’ Regiment of
the Women Volunteers, an organisation which a
Royal Proclamation has called back to life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Colossus</em> has yielded up its precious charge.
As the cutter bears Gloria de Lara away from the
great war monster’s side towards the white, graceful
<em>Eilean</em> that awaits her, the cannon belch forth their
parting salute and welcome in one breath. There,
standing on the deck ready to grasp her hand in a
deep and loving tenderness, with heartfelt gratitude
for her wonderful deliverance, stand the two beings
whom she loves most in the world, Speranza de Lara
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>and Evie Ravensdale. What human words could
describe that meeting, for they thought her dead, and
behold she is there in living life?</p>

<p class='c008'>Tilbury Docks are reached; the roar of distant cannon
announce her arrival. There she stands on the yacht’s
bridge with Evie Ravensdale by her side. As the
crowd sways to and fro to catch a glimpse of her, the
people see that she wears the White Guards’ Uniform.
The regiment is there to meet and welcome her. As
she leaves the yacht, its band strikes up the beautiful
march “Triumphant,” the same which had welcomed her
to the Hall of Liberty, when, as Hector D’Estrange,
she had performed the opening ceremony. The milk-white
steed which she had ridden on that occasion
now awaits her in its trappings of white-and-gold.
Never has horse been so groomed and petted as this
one.</p>

<p class='c008'>In sight of the crowd she bids her mother a courteous
and tender farewell, for Speranza has elected to drive
straight to Montragee House, there to await her child’s
return. A brilliant mounted throng await the former’s
coming; many well-known faces are there, amongst
which Gloria catches sight of those of Lady Manderton
and Launcelot Trevor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now she has mounted her milk-white charger
Saladin, and with Evie Ravensdale and Nigel
Estcourt on her right, and Flora Desmond and Archie
Douglasdale on her left, is riding slowly forward. In
close attendance behind are Rita Vernon and Léonie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Stanley. The latter’s eyes are busy in the crowd, and
seem to search the ranks forward as they ride along.
The brilliant throng of mounted friends close in, the
cheering of the crowd is deafening; it will be one long
loud roar until the Hall of Liberty is reached.</p>

<p class='c008'>The way is kept by the Women’s Volunteer Regiments,
and the order is perfect. As Gloria and Flora
ride along, they catch glimpses of old, tried, true, and
trusty friends among the ranks—friends who in time
of trouble stood by them, and laboured lovingly to
make easier the rugged path which they were then
treading.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a soul-inspiring sight. Many of the people
have brought flowers with them, and as the procession
approaches they cast them loosely in the air, out of
which they descend in a shower of many colours to
carpet the way, along which Gloria must pass, with
their bright and variegated bloom. The strains of
the White Guards’ band, the glitter of their white-and-gold
uniforms, the loud cheering of the enthusiastic
crowds as the brilliant cavalcade moves along,
is a sight which the onlooker is not likely to forget.
It thrills the hearts of that vast woman world,
assembled to do honour to the one who has worked
for and who has won their emancipation.</p>

<p class='c008'>One long triumphal march. One uninterrupted
scene of unchecked enthusiasm is the welcome accorded
her from the Docks to the Hall of Liberty. The sun is
shining on the gilded statues and million panes which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>crown that wondrous structure, as she approaches the
building which her genius conceived and raised,—approaches
it, no longer as the hunted felon upon
whose head the price of gold is set, but as a free
woman, a victorious general who has conquered the
demon armies of Monopoly and Selfishness, and thrown
open to the people the free gates of happiness and
reform. Now through the giant portals she rides
once more. Great God! what a burst of welcome,
and what a scene! From floor to ceiling the monster
building is crammed. Every available space has been
occupied; there is not a foot of standing room.</p>

<p class='c008'>She has uncovered, and they see her face as she
rides round the circular ride towards the huge platform,—the
same face of exquisite beauty which they
remember and know so well. As she dismounts, she
is received by the chairman of the committee appointed
to carry out the day’s proceedings, and to present the
people’s address of welcome, to which thousands of
representative names from every county have been
attached.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the platform are gathered every member of the
Ministry and every D’Estrangeite Member of Parliament.
Truly a royal welcome by staunch and faithful
friends; for as Gloria dismounts and steps upon the
platform she is greeted with a loud long cheer by
these men of generous mould, who have fought so
nobly on behalf of her holy cause. All honour be to
them for ever!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Sir Arthur Hazlerigg, Lord Mayor of London,
presents and reads the address of welcome, and as
he concludes it, Gloria de Lara stands forward to
reply. An intense silence falls. All are eager to
hear again a voice which they had believed to be
for ever stilled in death.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My friends,” she begins, and though the voice has
all the clear, ringing sweetness of yore, there is undoubtedly
a tremor in it, “it would require a special
language, one of which we have yet no knowledge,
to convey to you the emotions which this scene of
magnificent welcome awakens within me. From the
bottom of my heart I thank you for it, as well as all
those true and gallant friends who have created this
glorious day; for next to God it is the people who
have created it. In this welcome which you give to
me, the humble and all too unworthy representative
of a magnificent cause, the great principle of human
freedom is at length recognised, that freedom inherited
at birth, and only wrung from individuals by oppression
and wrong. Human freedom means the right to
take part in the creation of laws for the better government
and perfection of man; it means that man and
woman are born equal, are created to work hand in
hand for the greater happiness of mankind. Hitherto
this principle of mighty truth has not been recognised,
with the awful results shown forth in man’s ever-increasing
degradation. By the acknowledgment of
this principle you have laid the train which, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>fired, will put an end to immorality and social wrongs,
which will make evil unpleasant to perform, and
which will degrade the performer to the position of
a leper, the shunned and outcast of Society, loathed
and despised by his fellow-men. By the acknowledgment
of this principle, a day of darkness has sunk to
rise no more, and one of brightness, and promise, and
fair hope has arisen to cheer us along the glorious
path of reform. Much there is to be done, mountains
of prejudice, and selfishness, and greed yet to be faced
and conquered; but the army which the acknowledgment
of human freedom has raised, is an army which
will fight victoriously to the end; for it is an army in
which men and women will do battle side by side and
shoulder to shoulder, undeterred by class jealousies or
the odious assumption of superiority by one sex over
another. My friends, as I stand to-day in this Hall
of Liberty and look upon this magnificent scene,
memories rise up before me of a stirring and eventful
past. I see before me now, a picture which in childhood
I loved to imagine, a glorious reality which in
the past haunted my waking dreams. On many incidents
of that past I would prefer not to dwell,
arousing, as they must, the bitterness of human nature.
Rather is the province of the conqueror, of the victorious
to forgive and forget, to look forward to the
future, and strive for the possibilities which that
future may contain. We are starting along a new
path in life, a path open to all, not monopolised by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the few, a path which, as time goes on, shall show
traces of victory on all sides. I ask the great army
of my countrymen to endeavour to win those victories
as speedily as possible, so that in the future, the day
may dawn when there shall be no misery, no wickedness,
no crime. In that army, women now find a
place; let them triumphantly prove their right to be
there. They have yet an uphill road to climb, but
I have confidence that they will compass it, and now
that the gates of freedom are thrown open to them,
take part in all the great deeds of the world. Upon
them the eyes of this world will be fixed; upon them
depends the ultimate freedom of the human race. I
have no fear as to the result; I do not for one moment
dread the trial. I believe, moreover, that the presence
and natural companionship of woman will upraise
and influence man’s character for good, banishing
from his daily life those coarser habits which self-indulgence
and lack of moral influence have allowed
to creep therein, and that Society, in its remodelled
state, will thus be enabled to deal with the evils which
infest it. My friends, I need detain you no longer.
On my arrival in this country I was informed that
my old constituency had re-elected me as its member.
I rejoice to hear that I have several women fellow-members
in the Legislature to whom men, generous
and noble-hearted men, have relinquished places. To
tell you that the remainder of my life, which God has
so mercifully spared to me, will be employed in working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>for the people, in devoting every energy I possess
to their advancement, is the sum of my declaration
here to-day. Rest assured that for them, no one will
struggle harder than Gloria de Lara.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A simple speech, a quiet, honest declaration.
Though she stands there, the cynosure of all eyes,
there is no vanity or conceit in those few simple
words. Gloria’s aim is unveiled. It is the upraising
and triumph of humanity. She lives but to work on
its behalf.</p>

<p class='c008'>She is on the point of stepping back amidst a
perfect hurricane of cheers, when Evie Ravensdale
comes to her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One moment, Gloria; stay where you are,” he
whispers. “I have something to say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He raises his hand to ask for silence, and the people
accord it to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My friends,” he exclaims, “for with Gloria de Lara
may I not call you my friends? I have a pleasing
task to perform in that which I am going to say. As
Gloria de Lara has told you, the law of this country
has at length acknowledged the principle of human
freedom, and woman’s right to equal man is finally
recognised. When the country spoke out so unmistakably
on behalf of human freedom, my sovereign
bade me assume the reins of power. I accepted them,
not unwillingly; for the only object I had in life was
to carry out the great reforms which the genius of
Gloria de Lara had conceived, and of which she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>made me the confidant. At that time I believed, with
all others, that she was dead. But, my friends, she
is alive. And now I tell you that she only has a
right to assume the reins confided to me, she alone
has the right to carry those great reforms. The
person who conceived them alone has that right, and
I, her deputy, relinquish it to her. I tell you that
Gloria de Lara must be your Prime Minister, while
I will take my part as a humble worker with the
people. With the full approval of my colleagues
and every D’Estrangeite member, I intend forthwith
to tender my resignation, and to advise my sovereign
to send for Gloria de Lara.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There can be no mistaking the genuine ring of
approval in the mighty cheer that bursts forth from
the thousands of throats in that densely packed
building. Truly the child’s heartfelt prayer has
been answered in this splendid tribute paid to her
unselfish labours, from the days of childhood far
into those of womanhood.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Wealth and magnificence rear their forms in and
around the precincts of St. Stephen’s. They do
not, however, monopolise the entire space, for here
and there the squalid streets of poverty abide, with
all their <em>wealth</em> and <em>magnificence</em>, of suffering, crime,
and sin. One of these streets is just across the
river, and the clock in the big tower of the Houses
of Parliament can peep and peer therein, even from
its misty height.</p>

<p class='c008'>Staring from a dust-begrimed window on the second
floor of a dirty-looking dwelling situated in the street
named, stands a woman, whose rough, untidy hair is tied
back in a knot, and whose coarse, seared features show
signs of former enamelling, now disused. Poor wretch!
there is hunger and misery in her eyes, and despair
as well. Some would say insanity gleams there.</p>

<p class='c008'>She is listening to the cannons’ roar as they belch
forth their welcome to Gloria de Lara. Their booming
sound is maddening to the hungry, lonely, despairing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>woman, who stands there with not a friend in the
world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, he has forsaken her, got away scot-free himself,
but left her to wait for and look for him in vain.
Victoire Hester has parted with her jewellery and
tawdry finery for a mere song, the five-pound note
which Mr. Trackem gave her is expended, and she
has not a farthing left in the world. To-morrow she
must find three shillings for the rent of her miserable,
unhealthy room, and she has not got it, nor has a
morsel of food touched her lips this day. She is
broken-hearted. Worse than that, she is jealous,
angry, bitter. It maddens her to think of Gloria
at the pinnacle of success, and she who sought to
assist in her ruin, at the bottom of the abyss of
abject misery.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is left to her in the world? Nothing. Her
character is gone. She cannot find work, and if she
could, she would not undertake it. She has no heart
to do anything, for in her coarse, hard way, she loved
Trackem, loved him only to lose him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whose fault but hers?” she mutters angrily as
the cannon boom once more. “Why should she be
happy, while I die here like a dog? Not that I want
to live, I mean to die; but she sha’n’t live to be
happy, that she sha’n’t! I’ll send her first, and then
I’ll go myself. Ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Surely insanity rings in that voice. Poor Victoire!
You do not know how lovingly Gloria would forgive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>you, if she only knew the state you were in, how
eagerly she would seek to raise you from that fallen
state, and set you on the straight path once more.
But all this you do not know.</p>

<p class='c008'>She goes over to a tumble-down-looking chest of
drawers that has seen better days, and pulls open one
of the drawers. Out of this she takes a six-chambered
bull-dog revolver, examines it carefully, and slips it
into her pocket. It used to belong to Mr. Trackem,
and she had brought it away with her when she left
the house in Verdegrease Crescent, a few hours after
the departure of Inspectors Truffle and Bush. She
has kept it by her,—it is about the only thing she has
not parted with,—vaguely feeling that it may be useful,
if Mr. Trackem does not answer her piteous appeals in
the agony columns of the <cite>Times</cite>; for Victoire Hester
has determined to put an end to herself now that he
has forsaken her. The rich and well clothed may condemn
her, but who could, who diving into the arid
desert of that lonely, hopeless heart, beheld the mortal
wound inflicted by despair?</p>

<p class='c008'>The revolver safe, she next unearths an old woollen
shawl, which she flings over her head and pins under
her chin. Then she is ready, and she gropes her way
down the dark staircase into the street.</p>

<p class='c008'>She is hungry, weary, and weak, but she walks
briskly along, looking straight ahead of her. People
are hurrying across Westminster Bridge eager to
get a good place in the line along which Gloria de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Lara will pass on her way from the Hall of Liberty
to Montragee House. Victoire Hester is intent on
securing a good place too.</p>

<p class='c008'>And she is successful. She takes her stand in
Whitehall, not a stone’s throw from the Duke of
Ravensdale’s mansion. She will have a long time to
wait, but she steels herself to endure it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Denser and denser grows the throng, but Victoire
Hester, though pushed and hustled about, nevertheless
maintains her position in the front rank. She feels
she must hold that at any cost; it is necessary for
her purpose. There is a tremor in the crowd, as if
an electric current had passed through it. Now the
boom of cannon resounds once more. These warning
notes tell the people that the ceremony is over in the
Hall of Liberty, and that Gloria de Lara is leaving it
for Montragee House.</p>

<p class='c008'>A hum runs along the serried walls of human forms;
the electric current is apparently again at work. From
afar strains of martial music come floating to the
people’s ears, arousing them to the pitch of expectancy
and excitement. There is a dull continuous roar too;
it never seems to cease, as it rises and falls like the
waves of a turbulent sea, breaking upon the wild
shores of a rock-bound coast. Yet as it comes nearer,
the roar assumes a human sound; it is that of thousands
and tens of thousands of voices cheering lustily.
Victoire Hester’s trembling hand gropes in her pocket
for the revolver. She knows now that Gloria de Lara
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>is approaching, and that the moment which will close
her own life is at hand. Yes, surely insanity is writ
in those eyes as they stare hungrily forward. How
terribly they gleam!</p>

<p class='c008'>No one notices her, however. Every eye is bent
upon the approaching procession. There comes the
band of the White Guards,—how soul-stirring its
music!—and there, too, is the milk-white charger
Saladin, with arching neck and proud carriage; for
does he not bear a precious charge indeed, in the
person of Gloria de Lara?</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun gleams down upon her gilded helmet, and
lights with a living blaze the gold braiding upon her
uniform. How beautiful she looks as she rides along
with the glance of eager thousands upon her! How
she loves the people! How they return that love!
Surely none in that wildly enthusiastic crowd would
seek to harm her?</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, <em>one</em> would though, and we know who. The
madness in Victoire Hester’s brain is increased by the
scene before her. More than ever she questions the
right of this woman to be happy, to be the idol of
thousands, while she is doomed to be friendless
and miserable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Will no one stay her hand? Will no one arrest
and strike down the engine of death which she is
steadily raising and bringing to bear full on Gloria’s
breast? Ah! can no one in this moment of wild
excitement see the danger that threatens the idol of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>the people? See! Victoire’s finger is on the trigger!
God! can no one see and stay it?</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, one can see it, though she cannot stay it—one
whose glance has faithfully swept the crowd ahead of
Gloria all the way along. Only a pair of dark grey
faithful eyes, with a wondrous wealth of lashes shading
their intelligent depths, only a girl in years, yet with
the light of genius stamped on the beautiful forehead
above them. She sees and recognises Victoire Hester
in spite of her changed aspect and the mad look in her
eyes. Léonie Stanley sees the revolver raised and the
assassin’s finger on the trigger. Deep into her horse’s
flanks she drives her spurs. He springs furiously
forward, brushes roughly against Saladin and his rider,
and covers like a shield the person of Gloria de Lara.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only just in time though! The revolver’s note rings
forth, speeding from its lips the messenger of death;
yet another note, and it claims two victims for its own.
One is a wild, pale, haggard woman stretched out upon
the street, from whose temple blood is flowing, the
other a young officer of the White Guards’ Regiment,
who has fallen forward on the grey neck of her horse,
and whose blood is staining his dappled well-groomed
coat. Dear little Léonie, she has not lived in vain;
she has proved her love and gratitude at last; she has
shown how ill-fitting was the cloak of Judas, in which
the wicked had striven to clothe her. She has lived
to prove her gratitude, and is faithful unto death.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class='c005'><span class='c013'><strong>1999.</strong></span> It is a lovely scene on which that balloon
looks down,—a scene of peaceful villages and
well-tilled fields, a scene of busy towns and happy working
people, a scene of peace and prosperity, comfort
and contentment, which only a righteous Government
could produce and maintain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The balloon is passing over London, a London
vastly changed from the London of 1900. Somehow
it wears a countrified aspect, for every street has its
double row of shady trees, and gardens and parks
abound at every turn. This London, unlike its predecessor,
is not smoke-begrimed, nor can it boast of
dirty courts and filthy alleys like the London of 1900.
Every house, great and small, bears the aspect of
cleanliness and comfort, for poverty and misery are
things no longer known.</p>

<p class='c008'>A stranger in the balloon looks down with interest
upon this scene. His gaze, wandering across the
mighty city, is arrested by two gleaming gilded statues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>crowning a monster edifice, upon whose cap of glittering
panes the sun is shining brightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that the Hall of Liberty?” he inquires of his
guide.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answers the person addressed, “the same
as was raised a century ago by the great Duchess of
Ravensdale, of noble memory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is she buried there?” asks the stranger dreamily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Buried there! Ah, no!” replies the man almost
indignantly. “I thought all the world knew where
Gloria of Ravensdale sleeps. There is a beautiful
grave overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, on the shores of
Glenuig Bay. It is there where Gloria sleeps, by the
side of her husband Evelyn, the good Duke of Ravensdale.
It was her wish, and her wish with the nation
was law. Every year the grave is resorted to by
thousands, who lay upon it their tributes of lovely
flowers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is any one else buried there?” again the stranger
asks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir, a great woman, Lady Flora Desmond.
She survived Gloria of Ravensdale for many years,
and carried on her noble works of reform. She was
Prime Minister for twenty years, and her last request
was to be buried at the feet of the Duke and Duchess
of Ravensdale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Ravensdales owned immense wealth, and parted
with it all, so history says,” murmurs the stranger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, sir, they gave it all to the poor. At least,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>they spent it on the poor, and by their noble example
induced others to do likewise,” answers the man.
“There is no poverty in this country now, sir. As
we pass across it you will see evidence of peace
and contentment, and plenty everywhere. We owe
it all to the glorious reforms of Gloria of Ravensdale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is a very lovely garden not far from Westminster
Bridge which you lately pointed out to me,”
continued the stranger. “What a glorious wealth of
flowers!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! that sir is where Léonie Stanley saved Gloria
de Lara from assassination by a maniac. But she
lost her life in doing so. She was accorded a public
funeral, and by the wish of the nation buried where
she fell. The garden was laid out afterwards. It is
the nation’s pride to keep it beautiful. Léonie’s heroic
deed will for ever live in the hearts of a grateful
people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And where is the great Lord Estcourt buried?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the National Burial Ground, where only those
whom the nation loves to honour are laid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yonder splendid building is the Imperial Parliament,
is it not?” pursues the stranger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir. That is where the representatives of our
Federated Empire watch over its welfare. To Gloria
of Ravensdale we owe the triumph of Imperial Federation.
She lived long enough to see England, Ireland,
Scotland, and Wales peacefully attending to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>private affairs in their Local Parliaments, while sending
delegates to represent them in the Imperial Assembly.
Ah, sir! that Imperial Assembly is a wonderful sight.
Therein we see gathered together representative men
and women from all parts of our glorious Empire, working
hand in hand to spread its influence amongst the
nations of the world, with all of whom we are at peace.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The balloon is rapidly drifting northwards. As the
shades of evening begin to creep on apace it moves
along Scotland’s western coasts. The aeronaut in
charge of it guides it above the graves of Evie and
Gloria Ravensdale, and Lady Flora Desmond. As
the sun goes down across the western sea, it bathes,
with a farewell flood of glory, the last resting-place on
this earth of the great dead. The balloon descends,
guided by a skilful hand. It soon reaches the ground,
and in a short time the stranger stands by these graves.
Three simple marble hearts lie above them, on which
are engraved in golden letters the names of those who
sleep below. And at the head of the graves a marble
cross is standing with a few simple words thereon.
The stranger goes over to the cross, and reads:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='blackletter'>Sacred to the Memory of</span></div>
    <div class='c002'>GLORIA DE LARA, DUCHESS OF RAVENSDALE,</div>
    <div class='c002'>The mighty Champion of Women’s Freedom</div>
    <div>and the Saviour of her People.</div>
    <div>As also to that of Evelyn, the good Duke of Ravensdale,</div>
    <div>and the beloved and revered Lady Flora Desmond.</div>
    <div>Their names are engraved in the hearts of millions now</div>
    <div>and for all time. Amen.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Surely Gloria had triumphed? What greater reward
did she hope for than the welfare and love of
the people?</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>“A novel of stirring adventure, but also one with a purpose.”—<cite>Morning Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“In this novel, Lady Florence Dixie inculcates her well-known theories about
the education and position of women. The way is paved for various thrilling
adventures.”—<cite>Times.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“Lady Florence Dixie has the courage of her opinions; she writes freely and
frankly, with a natural grace of manner that makes her works interesting and
readable, and she has the art of writing a good story while enforcing her theories.
There is plenty of excitement, adventure, and interest in the story, and, apart
from its too startling title, Lady Florence Dixie’s novel will commend itself to the
reading public.”—<cite>Life.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“Under whatever impression the book is first opened, it is likely to be perused
for its own sake to the end.”—<cite>Sunday Times.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“Carries us through at breathless speed.”—<cite>Truth.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“That Lady Florence Dixie can write well, is shown not only by her natural
sketch <span class='sc'>Mœva</span>, but by the character of Lady Ettrick, and her charming sketches
at the opening of the youthful lovers Rory and Lorna, who certainly do not bend
to the customs of conventional society. Whatever else be said for or against the
novel it is indubitably exciting.”—<cite>Academy.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“Lady Florence is a vivacious writer; many of her social sketches are very
happy, and among her faults she certainly does not number that of dulness.”—<cite>Literary
World.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“Lady Florence Dixie always writes brightly&#160;... her dominant qualities are to
be found in ‘Redeemed in Blood.’”—<cite>World.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“On the subject of rational dress and the prevailing system of bringing up
young people, Lady Florence is neither silent nor soft spoken; she has very
pronounced opinions as to the way in which girls should be brought up, and
she gives free expression to them. She writes naturally, sensibly, and skilfully.”—<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“It is written with so much dash and go, and there is so much delightfully
fresh incident in it, that it is eminently readable.”—<cite>Glasgow Herald.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“There is no sham romanticism in the book; its literary workmanship is
vigorous. Whatever else Lady Florence may be, she is emphatically original.”—<cite>Scottish
Leader.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“The opening chapter contains some capital descriptive wanting, and the
interest is most cleverly kept up to the end.”—<cite>Newcastle Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“An attractive tale of adventure.”—<cite>Morning Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“We have had a great many stories of adventure showered upon us....
Some of these have been good, some, a large proportion, bad: many indifferent....
‘Raymi’ is more good than indifferent; it is certainly very far from being a bad
book of its kind.”—<cite>Daily News.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“There is much quaint and fresh interest about this well-written story of
adventures and wonders in far-away lands.... The relations of the girl (Clara
Savill) to the crew and her father are touched in with a firm hand, and
delineated in a way that invests this part of the narrative with all the charm of
truth to nature.... Let it suffice that in ‘Raymi’ we have a good stirring story of
adventure, which is marred neither by improbability nor extravagance.”—<cite>Public
Opinion.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“A tale of adventure and peril of surpassing interest is comprised in this large
and handsome volume.... It possesses all the traits that go to captivate
attention.”—<cite>Aberdeen Journal.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“A really cleverly written story of stirring sea fights and buccaneering deeds,
and strange adventures among a strange people.... Mr. Holland conducts his
hero through many marvellous nautical and terrestrial experiences with a skill
which seems to us not to fall very far behind that of Mr. Clark Russell....
‘Raymi’ has not a single fault that we can discover.”—<cite>Glasgow Herald.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“We have here a book to delight the heart and stir the pulse of adventurous
youth, besides containing much matter to interest ‘children of older growth.’...
The author’s story is all his own, and is not unworthy in plot and vividness of the
reputation won by his earlier work. The author traces with no little skill and
graphic power the remote wanderings and strange and thrilling experiences of one
Hugh Carton, a sailor lad, in distant parts.”—<cite>Birmingham Daily Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“This admirable romance. The adventures of the hero amongst ‘marvellous
scenes and marvellous people’ are related most vividly and with considerable
skill.... The sea fights and perils and dangers of the deep are also very well
done.”—<cite>Newcastle Dally Chronicle.</cite></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
